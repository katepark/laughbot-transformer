0 B:  Well, it's been nice talking to you.
0 A:  Have you ever lived in that part of the country?
0 B:  I agree with that.  Um, I, I noticed yesterday in the paper, something

0 B:  Yeah, exactly. 
1 B:  and they're illegal [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah exactly [laughter].  You can not take the gun home until you have

0 A:  Well I've enjoyed talking with you. 
0 A:  Oh really.
1 it, like I said, it's been thirteen years since we've really priced a
1 house so [laughter],
0 our price, that the, the value of our house went up, you know,
0 replaced twice because, uh, apparently the foundation shifts a little bit
1 designed the house, so it's our fault, 
1 split open or something.
0 A:  Uh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago, so.
0 A:  Well that's good.
0 B:  Okay.
1 course, if I didn't think that way, we wouldn't still be living here
0 A:  Well, thank you.
1 A:  Uh, there's really a lot, isn't there.
0 B:  Yeah, uh, I think you have to push one and then we can start recording it.
0 changes in the generations.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Hopefully, the next generation, it won't even be an issue, I mean people
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  It sure is.
0 B:  Uh-huh, oh yeah, I have to plan way in advance, because, or, what I've
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Well, um, I wouldn't, uh, I definitely wouldn't dispute that, it, it's
0 A:  Yeah, I have a, uh, well a mutt, myself.  I call it a, uh, uh,
0 B:  Okay.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Oh, I wouldn't doubt it, yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 smiling from ear to ear, she's so happy to see me.
1 when we come walking up to the front door.
0 in a dog like that.
1 B:  Yeah.
0 farm so I always had, uh, outdoor pets and,
0 A:  Oh, what a shame.
0 A:  Yeah, you really.  It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music.
1 A:  That's right.
0 some songs that, that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of, I'm
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think, I think it,
1 they're better than the Beatles, and I'm like, you know,
1 B:  you don't know what you're talking about.
1 B:  I mean, the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles
0 music.  Which is, you know, using all these natural forms of music and, 
0 example or, you know, the cream of the crop, I guess you could say, and then,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  if you can believe it, I mean,
0 own fun money and just stuff like that and then we write down each, each time
0 that year, we've taken that this year,
0 account with T I where they, we put in so much a month, and then they, or so
0 figure, to, put it, we're putting it in C D's right now,
0 A:  Yeah.  The other thing that we've done, that, that was really nice to see,
0 were pla-, what, what our, uh, goals were on a long term budget in terms of

1 B:  Yes, that's real easy to do, I have to watch it.  
0 A:  But, uh, he knows when he's overspends and when he doesn't and he knows
1 that anytime he pop up that credit card [laughter],
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Like credit cards.
0 and he bought, uh, a pair of shoes for me, and, uh, let's see, what else did
0 bought the shoes for the kids [laughter].
0 all.  Yeah.  So, uh, but yeah, uh-huh, I think we couldn't make it without
0 A:  Uh, uh, my hubby does not have, uh, too much control when it comes to
1 uh, you know, I think even one time we used it to pay our rent.
1 without having to think about what I was saying and, 
1 B:  Wonderful touch tone telephone there.
0 reading pleasures are quite wide.  Um, I get a charge out of, uh, TEXAS
1 B:  Um, well I hate to, yes, I do [laughter].
0 B:  Um, every now and then I'm loaned a tape I can stick in the, uh, in the
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, well, uh, maybe I am into some things occasionally that I
1 A:  I mean they are but I don't label it as such.
0 B:  Sure.  How about items like, um, THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, which used to be a
1 how to manage engineers [laughter].
0 difficult to, to know if it's, you know, I think if somebody would say hey,
0 B:  If he casually just walked into it and, uh, put down a Stephen King book
1 and I picked up one of them I might be a little more interested.
0 B:  it's always, they're always challenging to get through one of them.  I
0 A:  All right, I think we know what we're going to speak about.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  In public places.
0 A:  Exactly.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
1 B:  It almost should be the first twelve people that they, you know, have on
1 well he didn't have any blacks, uh, you know, from his neck of the woods.
0 B:  Well, really, this is, breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and
1 day to business suits the next [laughter].
0 B:  Well, I'm kind of that way too.  I work in the legal department and where
1 dig through boxes in a dress.
0 to your job,
0 us, did you know you're not supposed to do that.  That could have alleviated a
1 A:  Oh, how awful.  It sounds like Mr. Power Hungry.
1 ((culottes)) all you want but these were shorts.  That's all they were.
0 B:  Um.
0 B:  Well I've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend
1 shorts.
1 say I'm nuts, but I am more productive when I'm in pants.
1 A:  Yeah, that's terrible, that's terrible gosh.
1 A:  Isn't that funny.
1 know.
1 make, uh-huh [laughter].
1 B:  Weather-wise.  Damp, cold, warm [laughter].
1 then.
1 B:  I heard about that.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and golfing, reasons and things like that.
0 B:  The blue flu,
0 the spark plug,
1 B:  I envy you your ninety-four degrees.  
1 B:  Well, I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere.
1 B:  Gee, you've moved almost, moved around as much as I have [laughter].
0 A:  I mean it's just, uh, as long as you want to, and just, you know, a
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  So, that, that's really strange.  I, I was wondering why we had somebody
0 B:  So, I, [laughter] but that, that's interesting.  I have a, uh, uh, friend
1 B:  No, no, no, not that kind of music [laughter].
0 B:  Sure, yeah, I like them.
0 A:  Okay.  So, so then we got, we got some same things because,  
1 A:  well, they're like, for example, A C D C.
0 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, A C D C [laughter].
1 A:  Why, have you heard of them?
0 A:  Okay.
0 A:  But, see, for example, they have, see what, but other bands consider it
1 up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.
1 pumped it up.
0 A:  And, and, then what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make
0 B:  Was it really good?
0 B:  Oh.
1 B:  [Laughter]  Well, that's true [laughter].
0 B:  That's true.  But, I was more in the late seven-, well, I shou-, like mid

0 A:  [Laughter] Or Texas.  No that's not a good idea.
0 A:  Okay.
1 A:  Of course you could annex Cuba, but they wouldn't like that a bit
1 [laughter].
1 B:  He was really funny.  Both of the ones I met have been really funny guys.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 live in, uh, ((San Polo)) Brazil for four years.
0 approach and, and, and do we, do we support the Sandinistas or, or do we
0 support, uh, you know, when they thought, uh, they thought that Nicaragua, if
0 government, greedy, uh, rulers who have been, uh, manipulating, manipulating
0 B:  Well that, yeah, if the guys got some incentive, if he's got, uh, you
0 B:  no, no as a matter of fact, uh, Turner Broadcasting,

0 B:  with the permanent secretary,
1 bed, I have to get up and, and work the next morning.
0 it was, I don't think they should show it during prime time, but still,
1 B:  I guess not.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Good night!
0 question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.  Uh, I know
0 would be a negative step to make and I think that that they would need to
0 California and I didn't have any problem with my students but I noticed my, my
0 B:  I'm, I'm an avid aerobics, [breathing] uh, person and just very, very
0 exercise, but, I very rarely do things like, um, I've never done aerobics or
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Well, you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming
1 B:  I'm sorry.  
1 B:  all over the country.  
0 B:  [Breathing].
0 you know, you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or
0 whatever.  And, uh, oh the, the, the uni-, University of California at Berkeley
0 A:  that have taken that approach.  And, um, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 towards doing the exercise.  And, I guess because they spend all day in back
0 A:  -- but at least traditionally, #the laborers, last thing,# 
1 conscious.  But they, you know, they live to a hundred and ten some
0 B:  Yeah,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Oh, are you also [laughter],
1 A:  Yes [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
1 weather this year because we went to California instead [laughter].
0 B:  So it's, it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are
1 New Hampshire you always have that kind of weather. 
1 B:  Well that was one reason why I figured that I could stand Lubbock, Texas.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 A:  And that's so I could leave by seven. 
1 B:  and it, we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody
1 jump, and, uh, uh, whatever the expression is, I'm, I'm real close [laughter].
1 B:  #There you go.#
0 A:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Well it's like I keep telling people, you don't have to
1 shovel sunshine, you know,
0 used to have in New England and we used to enjoy that.  We had, uh, we had two

0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 uh, what do you call them, putting some programs into the, on the disc, and,

1 on [static].
1 was the, the Atari, toot toot,

0 like you were the authority. I felt like,
1 A:  if I came in just in jeans or,
0 second language, so I didn't have your average freshman,
1 A:  or something, rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe
0 [laughter].
0 B:  Exactly, exactly.
1 A:  acceptable. You know, if you wear, um, pastels, it needs to be warm
0 A:  And otherwise, you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason
0 A:  and light colors repeal themselves?
0 A:  Huh-uh.
1 A:  two holidays. 
0 B:  I live here in Plano. 
1 B:  You can't just wear your sweats and an old tee-shirt. 
1 A:  No, [laughter] you can't. 
1 [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] and now that is.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Well, thank you, you have a good day.
0 A:  It's north of Sherman.
0 rather than put them in prison, because prison's proven not to work, just let
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 B:  But, uh, you know, with the technology we have today, you can put a collar
0 will just in incapacitate them.
1 A:  No, apparently not, because look how many years they've been doing that and
0 A:  comes, yeah. 
0 A:  If they see violence at home, that's what you're going to get from the kids
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  You look at Frito Lay.  My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist.
1 B:  That's my case also.  I've got a new born and there's just no time.
1 two hundred, and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this
0 A:  -- of what I'm low on.  
0 B:  Oh, yes.  And that does take some time.  And if we're trying to get
0 acclimated with the, uh, with having a baby, and (( )).
1 B:  And just into everything, so there's not a spare moment.

1 B:  She wanted her shoe off.
1 B:  No, no.
1 B:  I was talking.  My little girl wanted her shoes off.  
0 A:  The schools were all closed this week and, there still thinking of closing

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 few.
0 flowers.
0 B:  No, I never have, uh,

0 so it,
0 A:  getting too much for her.  So, I just quit.  I'd rather quit and take
1 B:  Well, you know, kids, kids [laughter].
0 B:  do those.
1 B:  Yeah, I don't either.  It's not until you have kids, I guess, you
1 but I've enjoyed talking with you.

0 A:  It was unusual not to have the different sources, you know, of news
0 coverage.
0 news than.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view, and it
0 like that.  I'm from Dallas and, uh, we have a lot of bad stuff, uh, it just
1 A:  So then, you wake up one morning and you are in war with somebody you don't

0 =========================================================================
0 B:  Well, I can relate to, uh, when I decided to choose a college.  Uh, it

0 where at least they'll have a chance to get ahead.
0 B:  Yeah, well, I, I started, uh, studying mathematics basically because I was
0 really good at that in high school, and, uh, by the time I was a sophomore, I
0 B:  So, I started taking computer science courses and, uh, that become my major
0 A:  Well, it still is.   
0 B:  Uh, still is, that's true.  ((It's, uh)), very good choice. 
0 in, uh, computer science and engineering departments, and I'm sure that
0 school, and, uh, I just, [laughter], I have to question how worthwhile it is
1 A:  Hey, I'm headed there [laughter].   
1 B:  Well, yeah, somewhat [laughter]. 
0 B:  That's, back to the reason why, why I joined the band, that was my
1 team manager.  We got, I got to ride the bus all over the state [laughter].
1 B:  Whether you like the mascot or not, or whether [laughter] it's close by.
0 B:  So, I was very pleased with that, of course, I lived like a pauper too
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 A:  Aren't, aren't they like put, taking the words and, and listening to the
0 B:  Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that
0 that I knew both the people and the inc-, incidences,
0 A:  Right.  What did you think of the news coverage of the war? 
0 B:  Uh, i-, I spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence

0 B:  How do we know, how do we know when the time's up?
0 B:  You want to go first, or me.
1 that I take off under tables when I'm in a conference room,
0 B:  and, and, I mean, that's even in the winter time.
0 B:  But I, I don't ever feel the need to dress that warmly.  I, I don't have to
0 and, then, you know, you'd, but what happens is, uh, what I've seen here on
0 same as jeans.
1 standard of dress, and he's, he dressed like the janitor,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 company, yeah.  It was, uh, about eight or nine thousand people when I got
0 little watches --
0 watches to time the games and I'd be out on the field, middle of the field at

0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 apartment [laughter].
0 B:  All right, bye-bye.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  Well I guess the only people I've talked to before were from

0 A:  uh, started in Italy, went to England, France, some in America, uh, also
0 A:  Is that right?
1 A:  But when I moved to California and all of a sudden I had this, uh, this
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Oh really, yeah.

0 A:  I didn't know it made the national news.
1 more.
0 B:  Yeah, you know, and I, I don't know if it would be, but I mean, we don't

0 B:  So I mean, it, it's like, where does this all stop.
0 B:  Yeah --
0 B:  Yeah, I, I do myself.  I really think that it's, it's all well and good to,

1 B:  I think all our laws are really screwed up.
0 B:  Or whether or not to, uh, institute, you know, capital punishment where it
1 the same time.  So that's my husband's deal.  He's out there, you know
1 B:  Oh, okay.  My only other standard menu, I guess, is, uh, Thanksgiving
1 B:  And your standard vegetables, like you always had to have some peas and
1 green onions.
0 B:  It's not the soft, you know, kind of, uh, rolls that they have here.  It
1 A:  That's like eating sandpaper.
1 A:  Yeah, well, also New Year's down here you've got to have black eyed peas.
1 A:  I'll eat it as long as I'm not around while it's being cooked.
1 B:  Any decent food in your cafeteria up there?
1 A:  I think so too.
1 they, they had, they had three kinds of potatoes.
1 A:  They had mashed potatoes, they had French fries, and they had au gratin.
1 A:  That's overdoing it.
1 ingredient, no matter what you're making, garlic [laughter].
0 a hamburger.
0 B:  And they make them different flavors, like, oh, they have a chocolate chip
1 A:  And they're pretty good sized, too.  But I usually wind up getting a donut
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Like I really need the cholesterol.
1 A:  I don't like them cleaning up the dishes [laughter].
1 like the kitchen is a disaster area,
0 B:  Uh, as long as I can remember. 
0 A:  Huh.
0 B:  In Denison.
0 A:  Yeah, like who?
1 B:  An-, I can name a few more, I just can't think of their names,

0 A:  No, no, they're still in elementary.
0 get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school, then it's like
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  There's different ways to do it.  Like I, I think going two six weeks and
1 A:  Yeah, I know.  
1 B:  #And, and #[laughter],
1 B:  Um, that's interesting, and how many administrators is that going to take?
0 question of, of how much reading do those kids' parents do.

0 like we used to have in school.  Like our principal says, I want every child
0 A:  Yeah.  {Dishes clanging}.
0 B:  I have nothing to say about this.

0 A:  Or I'll go, you know, do a (( )).
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, they couldn't cover my hourly rate [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 A:  Kind of like joining the military.
0 B:  Didn't mean to cut you off there.
0 A:  That one was interesting because I talked to a man in, in Washington, D C,
0 I talked to somebody about credit card usage.
0 you, #you can do certain things with them.#
1 B:  Yeah, I don't have too much of a green thumb either.  So.
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, as, as long as you give it, uh, good drainage and, uh, lot of,
0 A:  Right.  We've got a few things, too.  It's hard to tell if they'll come
0 A:  Yeah.
0 trees out front.  I've enjoyed doing those.  I put, uh, pansies out in the
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  Those do pretty well here, don't they.
0 forty-five by ninety feet.
1 A:  -- doesn't look too good.  So I can't say anything about anybody else's
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 like the oaks a lot.
0 B:  They're very hardy for this area.
0 B:  I don't think they do that for shrubs.
1 B:  Okay.
1 B:  I forgot all about that that it had to be pressed.
0 parents sort of stuck us in front of a T V to be the baby-sitter.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  So there was always, there was never just one alone, you know.
0 that's his mother --
0 B:  Well that's it then, I think, probably maybe that, that.
0 A:  But, see, um, when I was younger I used to say that I would like to have
1 A:  You know.
0 A:  Yeah.  And see, and then, my mom and dad, like whenever, like we would go
0 A:  we all got, we're still, like I'm still covered under my mom and dad's
1 @B:  Uh, well, to tell you the truth, my husband does most of the work.
1 B:  Yeah, that's fine [laughter].
1 B:  No, well, last, uh, no I do enough other things, I don't feel guilty about
1 that [laughter].
0 very first time, I did mow the grass.  My first time in my whole life.
1 that's, I think that's about all they make [laughter].
1 A:  I've been having it treated.  And it makes it grow much faster.  Uh,
0 A:  Well, in the summer time so that the heat doesn't, uh, burn the grass.
0 A:  Um, I real-, I've got a mixture I guess [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh really.  ((We don't have one of those)).
1 A:  And, uh, I'm trying to find a way how to electrify it or motorize it
1 [laughter]. Because this I have to push.
0 A:  I haven't been very successful.  I'm on my third year now, and I still have
1 B:  It's not composting.
0 A:  Chem-, no chemicals in it.
1 B:  Uh-huh, oh [laughter],
1 B:  Hey, that'd work for me, let me tell you [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, well, as far as that goes, yeah, I mean, you wouldn't like to see
0 her emotions --
1 A:  I'm, I'm intrigued by it, but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet
0 B:  So, the, the end scenes are, are kind of suspenseful, you know, when she
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Um.
1 A:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  That's strictly for entertainment [laughter].
1 player more so than he is, because he really played the part good.
0 TERMINATOR.  At first, you know, it was kind of strange,
0 B:  And she wat-, she watches these really gross things you know, like,
0 A:  Yeah, uh-huh.
1 as well just plan on staying up all night, because you know [laughter],
0 A:  Oh, 
1 B:  Oh, yeah {imitating a crying child}.  She's so nice, she can't die
1 A:  Oh [laughter].
1 people like us, you know [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter]  Oh,
1 mine, but the other day I got one about fishing and I thought, oh, my.
1 A:  I don't know a thing about fishing, so I'm not even going to try
1 [laughter].
1 B:  Say, well, I know it takes a fishing pole and some bait, and some water
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  country I guess.   
0 know, we just have, every once in a while, have epidemics of,
0 A:  {Very faint} Yeah. 
0 A:  {Very faint} Yeah. 
0 B:  and that's how I think a lot folks carry,  
1 B:  Yeah, my, the older I get, the less I like the cold up here I'll tell you
1 [laughter],
0 A:  you could go out in short sleeved shirt, and it wasn't that
0 B:  Yeah, that's nice out through there.  I've got a,  
0 or like more it all depends [laughter],
0 A:  Yeah.  In fact, I think they showed on the, they showed the United States
1 ice age.  And I think you all were about a mile and a half deep in ice
0 B:  And, uh, that, that's really nice to look at, uh, #the summers are hot.#
1 A:  I sure hope we, I sure hope we don't get a hard freeze, 
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 A:  It kills a lot of the bugs and the,
0 B:  How long have you been with T I, uh, 
0 B:  Okay, um, have you ever been involved in any trials?
0 I, I've, I took a little business law in, in college and, and I've, you know,
0 judge, uh, a three judge panel I should say, I think he can,
0 B:  And, um, I went to court and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic
0 do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial.  I'm
1 like ((God)),
0 B:  Jeez.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  -- and I usually come away thinking, no I really don't like this show
1 [laughter].
1 more, I mean, you know, basically stepping on things and yelling in pain --
1 name.
0 B:  -- and, uh, so a lot of times they have the, the, the, international films
0 A:  #Did you go with kids though?#
1 A:  -- just, just to get a sense for, you know, how, how it affected them.
1 MUTANT NINJA TURTLES could have been a classic of world theater --
1 that,
0 B:  Right.
1 snob,
0 there's always something that, uh,
0 think it's, I think, I can think of movies I have less fun during and then
1 A:  -- or something, because I'm not that old [laughter],
1 A:  Okay, well, um, thanks for hearing me rap, I guess [laughter].
0 A:  No, I'm in California (( )).
0 stresses that you talk about have, have taken a long time to become
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 want to change them, but you stay in those roles for so long that it's, it's
0 can do in any even twenty or thirty year period of time, you know.
1 A:  It would be an exhausted test [laughter]. 
1 meal, 
1 better --
0 they ever were, as far as what they have learned and what they're capable of
0 and I --
1 A:  -- I have the kids clamoring for my attention now, 
1 A:  [Radio] [Talking] Uh, being a former drug user [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter]  Whoa.
0 A:  And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there, uh, whenever you

0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- in, in the plant.
0 factory kind of environment that way --
1 A:  You're kidding [laughter].
1 times, I think.  And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group [laughter].
0 A:  I can't believe I was so {pause} brazen before.  I, like I say, I'm a
0 B:  So I think some place, you know, places like that, it should be like
0 B:  -- #type stuff,# you know, at T I.  I forgot what, I guess it was like
0 B:  That's awful.
0 B:  Uh-huh, that's,
1 B:  Uh-huh, I see.
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.  
1 A:  Oh yeah.
0 it was done with a sprayer and, uh, up in the bucket of a loader tractor, or
0 something like that, so, it took a lot of the hassle out.  And then --
1 A:  No, I wouldn't think so [laughter].
1 A:  Oh, we got to do that this summer.  We're dreading it.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 if it does got a dent in it --
1 A:  Oh, wha-, what else can I tell you about painting?  
0 B:  Uh.
1 B:  Yeah, that's a strange situation, you're a citizen, yet you can't vote.
0 people there speak only Spanish.  I'm not sure how fluent they are in English,
0 A:  Um.
0 A:  Uh.
1 Pierre, he's, or, uh, P-, uh, Pedro, he's the best,
0 way they do things.
0 attaining a fifty-first state is what would we do about our flag.  How do you
1 arrange fifty-one stars?  [laughter].
1 B:  So, I don't know.  [music] And it's also a long way away [laughter].
0 A:  What is their major industry?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  What, what is, do you have a favorite recipe?   
0 A:  what I'm going to have. 
1 B:  Oh, definitely.  I think better even than, than other kinds of food
0 B:  Yep.   
0 they look easy enough to make it's not,
1 B:  Oh, well, that's good because I know they've been really expensive lately.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.   
0 hundred dollars [noise], and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but I
0 it.  I guess you could use a hand mixer but I don't think it pur-, I don't
0 A:  And then before the milk gets too hot, um, I add two beaten eggs and I
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Yeah, that cocoa, yeah, the unsweetened.  It comes in like a real dark can,
0 A:  something she had collected out of WOMAN'S DAY or something.
0 to get the cornstarch,
1 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Uh, I wouldn't know what to do with it.   
1 B:  We're just discussing what we'd do with five thousand.   
1 B:  and I know that the coach there gets a million dollars when he quits,
0 B:  Yeah, I heard about that.  I haven't heard much about it though.
0 A:  But that seemed like it was actually, uh, you know, if there's a good way
1 @@B:  Yeah, well, we veered from the subject.   
1 B:  I hope so.   
0 A:  Well, sounds like you participated quite a bit.
0 has to say now that they've got them all lit.
0 A:  Oh, okay.

0 B:  My God, I can't imagine.
1 A:  Yeah, in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion
0 went to a, relatively small school for my first two years and then I
0 problems,
0 got a lot of, uh, M I T graduates that are in there and they are the biggest
1 B:  Nope.   
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   
0 B:  Right.   
0 B:  Oh, okay, that's why, go ahead.   
0 a, a movie --
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 B:  I think he was like a Italian director or something like that --
1 probably all these really good looking young people, you know, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, I hear that's pretty good [music].   
0 B:  It was, it was about, uh, a guy, uh, Nicholas Cage does Elvis Presley, like
0 B:  and things like that.  So they tried to make it pretty, you know, close
0 A:  But I didn't see WALL STREET.   
0 campus?
0 and raid it.
0 husband's, uh, been growing, uh, lots of flowers from seed and,
0 A:  and had them in little planters all over the house and my cats got to
1 A:  Yeah, these two cats, it's hard to keep anything around.   
1 A:  Yeah, really.   
1 A:  Kitty cat, what do you think about being a star [laughter].
0 B:  and weed killers.   
1 A:  I'll take my chances with it.   
0 B:  It's a perfect day for it.
0 B:  Yeah, I, I love spring.  I just love it.   
1 A:  Yeah, it's, I don't know I was expecting snow and all of that.
0 A:  But, uh,  
0 B:  Oh, well it sounds like you need to move back there.   
1 A:  Yeah, I, I've been thinking about it.   
1 B:  What, Brittany?  Okay, good hon {speaker is talking to child}.  Sorry,
0 A:  I'm a, I'm a student, uh, uh,
1 anything, so I took it and the subject was, discuss the weather,
1 A:  I mean, yeah, gosh, what's your weather like, you know. 
1 A:  Well, I don't know, let me look out my window.  Yeah, it's kind of foggy
1 tonight [laughter].
1 A:  Oh.  
0 beautify the place.
0 B:  Oh [breathing]. 
0 A:  It's a shame.   
0 A:  Yeah, absolutely tasteless.   
0 A:  Yeah.  I, I buy them every once in a while and, and I bought one and it
0 A:  and then I said, well, I'll try another one, so this is several weeks
0 B:  -- mostly people they know.  So in those instances, uh, that's, uh, I think
1 A:  Yeah, I think that was a logical decision there.   
0 B:  Uh, I guess it was, uh, they brought in their verdict and sentence at the
0 B:  -- they can ask questions.   
0 A:  Uh, but, uh, asking questions during the trial, my experience as a juror,
1 A:  Okay.   
1 to the topic.
1 A:  Okay [laughter].   
1 A:  Okay.   
1 A:  Well, say hi to Al, or Hal the next time you see him.   
1 B:  And, uh, so I've heard the name and, uh, well, back to the topic
0 chance to pick it up, like this week I noticed several copies have been un-,
1 uh, dog just ran off with my shoe, [laughter] that's off the subject,
0 A:  Well, I wouldn't think th-, I would really say that that's not true,
1 variety to choose from.
0 of that and I listen to a little of ninety point one.  I, I'm, I'm inveterate
1 A:  Um.  Well I am, we're fairly new to the area and so we're still shopping
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  That's true.  So that really effects how they report the news.
1 little too cutesy but, 
1 B:  Oh, I see.  Yeah, so then we've been having just about the same weather
0 [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  No, I'm from Wisconsin originally.   
1 B:  Yeah, we did, w-, they're always mild to me compared to New York winters.
1 A:  [Laughter] Okay I can believe that, uh-huh.   
1 go to the beach next Wednesday,
1 B:  Yeah.  I'm sure it will in Dallas, Texas [laughter].   
1 B:  Not necessarily, not the ice.   
0 A:  There is no, uh, ice removal equipment.   
0 Oklahoma and --
0 B:  Oh.  
0 other day, so didn't feel like going outside and doing much [clicking].
0 B:  And, uh, they're coming up really pretty. {pause} Just need a, just need a
0 forget about them and it gets too hot out there and, and they, you know, burn
0 guess that it's supposed to be nice.
1 A:  So I like Gordon Lightfoot, do you know who he is?   
0 B:  Uh-huh.  So you like a, a variety.   
1 you know, my wife left me, my dog left me, you know [laughter].
0 A:  Forgot about that.   
0 uh, uh, the, I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection.
0 B:  -- and I like [laughter], I like, uh, [lipsmack], uh, let me think who, uh,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 to hear it.  But it's not as, it's not like, uh, Chicago where it's got that
1 B:  Oh, okay.  You're going to Commerce?   
1 A:  Just because there's a friend up there, not because there's much else
0 different areas.  That's why I was just w-, 
1 A:  They're not going to recruit me anymore, I'm through.   
1 B:  [Laughter].   
0 Because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not
0 B:  So but,   
0 B:  you could probably get it a little closer.  But then there's another
0 thing that I disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six and
0 B:  And that way it would give, you know, the probation department and parole
0 reasonable amount of money --
0 A:  That's the part that I really think we need to change.
0 A:  Uh-huh.    
0 B:  is there, is there a basis for it.   
1 B:  And, you know, we're supposed to be, and I quote, in a democratic society.
0 A:  Yeah.   
0 B:  Oh, that was sad, wasn't it.   
1 forty-niners to win.
0 A:  I think it was.   
1 haven't produced since then but, 
0 the coast, actually I live, like, right on the coast of North Carolina --
1 before,
1 you got hit and you fell, you didn't really feel it.
0 A:  You just felt the hit of the person, but when you hit the ground, it was,
1 A:  Yeah, this is the first time I've talked with someone up north.
1 B:  Right [laughter].   
0 @A:  Okay the topic that we had Victoria, again, as I mentioned was, what do
0 A:  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
0 where I went to school was one of the best counties,
0 to look at one thing, we've lost, oh, kids used to have a respect for the
0 A:  at one time, but I think we've kind of lost that in our school system and
0 B:  Exactly.
0 A:  What is, what is your major in school that you're,
0 B:  Uh-huh.    
0 A:  Have a nice one, Victoria.   
1 A:  And I, I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible
0 A:  Uh, THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and, uh, uh, I forget the t-, the other, well he,
0 PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection --
1 you know, uh, gosh, if, if I read straight out of the Bible to her she'd
0 guess ho-, I don't know, horror, Steven King type books.
1 A:  Uh, there's another guy.  Oh, what can, what is his name [lipsmack].
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
1 B:  Yeah, I think they did a pretty good job, but [throat_clearing],
1 B:  Yeah.   
1 B:  Yeah,  
1 B:  Me, too [laughter]. 
1 A:  He's written a lot of books.   
0 B:  Yeah, uh, I think his name was Bachman.  He wrote under the name of
0 B:  Yeah [breathing].  Ooh, I wish I could do that [laughter].
0 B:  I do, too.  I love old, good old,
1 A:  Once you can get into the language, you know, the l-,  
0 B:  -- literature.   
0 A:  Yeah, yeah me, too.   
1 B:  I think we have, too.   
0 ===========================================================================
0 B:  Oh, he just, like, totally sarcastic and hilarious and, I don't know, I'm a
0 A:  All he saw was my hair and he goes, do you want to dance.  I turn around
1 and go, what!
0 A:  But, okay, so d-, wait do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE yesterday?
0 B:  Trying to write an essay, you start talking about, you know, [laughter]
0 B:  No, unless, 
1 A:  And were here, and I go, so what happened worldwide, you know.
1 guard who's a hundred and five years old,
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  -- but then we started watching it.   
1 ((ourself)) to watching golf --
1 really watch that?
0 A:  Somebody told me, like, that, like, you can watch baseball, and the actual
0 B:  Uh.
1 A:  And so then I said, I'm going to move back up there to go to college.
0 else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so.
0 which they could move, you know, that it was that easy for them to find new
0 insurance by the reserve, then I don't think this would have happened.
1 A:  Um, I think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it
0 B:  And so you think that it's just gone.   
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
1 me like they've gotten around what was [laughter],
1 B:  intended to be the issue there.   
1 went bankrupt.
1 B:  Yes, and I hate it [laughter].   
1 B:  Had some health problems that have led me to, uh, I'd say more on than off
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year
0 A:  It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines.  But I
1 now.
1 B:  Yeah, it's nice because when the weathers bad you can't, you don't have any
1 use [laughter].
1 of doing that,
1 B:  Yeah, well, don't let it collect dust.  At least exercise while dusting it
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Uh, I need to,  
0 A:  [Laughter].   
1 B:  so I'm upset [laughter],  
1 A:  Yeah.   
1 A:  or Jane Fonda.   
1 B:  [Laughter].   
0 was back,
1 either.
1 B:  [Laughter].   
0 A:  It's on E S P N, uh, at what time, I can't remember what time.  It's, uh,
1 A:  uh, I haven't done so much as, uh, watch the tape that I made. 
0 and they think, what difference is it going to make whether I vote or not,
1 don't want to be called for jury duty or --
1 elections, uh, even down to the, uh, school board type, uh, elections,
1 get just as good of results as if I through darts at a board.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Yeah.  You,
0 A:  Huh.  Boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important,
1 just to do away with the cost of the elections,
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 uh, a minor inconvenience.  It was certainly worth it,
0 A:  After work.    
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 in the line itself,
0 little later tha-, as it were, and, and make the, the effort to vote.  Uh,
0 candidates, and helped me make a lot of better informed decisions.  But still,
1 A:  Yeah, at least [laughter].  
0 more conservative and still have the death penalty, and I think, I know
0 A:  Because, I was ten, and I don't remember a lot about anything at that time
0 know, get rid of some of the atrocities that were going to.  I don't, I don't
0 couldn't believe that they would, that they would be mean, and, and, and, and
0 more justice at home.  I'm not sure how we get that, [laughter] wonder if
0 B:  that they, that they, uh, they didn't destroy everybody,
0 B:  Why did you do it that way [laughter].  
0 humbly go to their other king, or the other ruler, and say, what have we done
0 assaulted --
0 to, to take authority over that, and I know people that have done that.  I
0 B:  A lot of debate going on with that.  
0 not going into it for the, for the money, nor the prestige, or whatever.
0 uh, it, it, it, it may sort of lead to some, uh, it, it, it may just be
0 B:  -- possibly I think that, uh, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm actually Jewish, so I
1 A:  -- I've yet to have any so [laughter],
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 A:  My only hope is that, uh, is that whatever, I'm going to wined of being
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  -- because that typically is very, otherwise, I can't imagine it.
0 A:  It would,
0 B:  I, I just don't see how a person could, could put enough, away enough
0 A:  Uh, but that is a real, a real, I mean, that's a real good way to do it, I
0 B:  Yeah.
0 wide, because I worked for Tex-, Texas Instruments,
0 ========================================================================
0 A:  And all of that was new to me,  because I'm sort of feeling like we're
0 really, you know, kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your
0 hard, but, um, I think that is what we have to have, you know, have our
0 B:  Yeah.  I think, yeah. 
1 dollars to get licensed in Texas and now,
1 something.
0 I think, you know, our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay
0 A:  In that, even if they made that kind of money, there's some countries that
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes, I wouldn't
0 thing might be changing but,
0 get what you pay for and I want to be here and I enjoy, I enjoy living here in
1 better let you go.
1 A:  you get what, uh, get luck of the draw but,
1 B:  Yeah [laughter]. 
0 B:  but, you know, we don't do too much during the Summer, as far as tomatoes
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  You've had more freezing this Winter, or this, yeah, Winter, I think.
1 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].   
0 B:  -- and I use a, one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water
0 A:  Oh that's great.  
0 newspapers --
1 B:  Get out there on your hands and knees,
0 our cabbages, and broccolis and that [talking] {people in background} we have
0 A:  Oh it's delicious and it goes real good on dandelions.  
0 A:  And, we have, we have hills.  I'm afraid of the hills [laughter] but,
0 A:  That's, a lot of people don't have that much space even.
0 B:  I have the room outside I need, and I don't really have all the room in the
1 house I need but,
0 A:  [Laughter] Well, you never have enough room do you think.  
0 B:  ((Rolly Polly)) bugs.  The ones that roll up in a ball.  I don't know what
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Oh really.    
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  They're like a, water bug, 
0 B:  When you touch them, they roll up.
0 February, at the most.
1 he sprays his yard, and you get them back again [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Ours are going to be coming out.  Now our cancer society sales
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Hi, Chris, this is Carol.    
1 A:  like they do in public service.  I suppose the idea is to, um, I don't
0 A:  {Very faint}, it sure does.  
0 A:  Um, forcing someone to give up a couple of years of their life, uh, doing
0 A:  That's right.  And some young people do.  Some young people,
0 B:  That's true.   
1 At least I, m-, I'm, I don't think I would vote for it if it came down to
0 what you're doing to help, I think, that's more important than,
1 A:  i-, it is interesting to think about it [laughter].
1 @@B:  [Laughter] Does kind of catch you by surprise [laughter].
0 flower beds, things like that, but they've, uh, they've gone a few years of
0 neglect.
0 A:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  My wife and I, we live in Dallas too, so. 
1 A:  I mean just, just scratching two or three inches was just a chore.
1 different varieties and each one works in one part of town and that's it,
0 A:  Like what, um, what type roses?   
0 B:  Uh, different, uh, a few different, uh, hybrid tea type varieties.
0 A:  Yeah, we, we have a few, uh, of the real short stem.  They're kin-, they're
0 just seem to survive just fine there.
0 B:  Uh, we've been, we've been pretty lucky on that.   
1 plant grass and they just, [laughter], have some problems,
1 A:  so they just ((washing)), uh, watching their lawn just blow away.
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 A:  And they said, well, we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just,
0 A:  that property out there.  And, uh, I don't know, that what they have,
0 to have to spend just getting that.  But the taxes alone there, Lake
0 A:  But, um, the water usage, you know, they try to limit, even though there's
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 farming but,
1 see how anything can survive out there,
1 B:  [Laughter].   
0 B:  Yeah, when I, when I mentioned I've done this camping out of the car, I've
0 B:  Oh, yeah.   
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 don't, I'm not sure what else will be able to lug it around the ((hills up
0 A:  I'll be looking forward to, to like I say win-, Winnebago because of the
1 to jack it up [laughter].
1 A:  I just want to (( )) and just turn the key off and get in the back and do
0 B:  Well, I appreciate it.   
1 B:  And good luck with your, uh, your fut-, your hopes of buy a Winnebago
0 used to give me silver dollars so I've got a few of those,
0 A:  Yeah.   
1 A:  Yeah, I think they're fakes [laughter].   
0 B:  Gee.   
0 B:  That's [laughter], you might be sitting on a gold mine.   
0 A:  Huh.   
1 A:  Gosh, all these years I've been thinking they were fakes, maybe they're
1 A:  Sounds like some of the coin dealers I know [laughter].   
1 just made them last night.
1 Lebanon last year [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, well the,  
1 B:  Um, it sounds like I'm wise [laughter].   
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   
0 B:  Oh.   
1 A:  I'll give you a nickel for it, you know [laughter].   
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Oh, fajitas, how do you make fajitas?   
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
1 called,
1 B:  Here in Texas it's all, you know, Tex-Mex cooking and barbecue and,
0 B:  if you've ever, you know, had stuff like that.  Yeah, it's totally
0 A:  Right, right. 
1 know.
0 A:  Huh.  That's one of my favorite.   
1 what they accomplished,
1 B:  I thought I already had it figured out and I did and that made me mad
0 A:  Yeah, that's, that's my favorite.   
1 A:  Well, I'm, I'm a struggling law student,  
0 A:  and I, the reason I like it is because they give you good law in there.
1 B:  You know, like they, they at least, you know, they've been in a courtroom
0 format,
1 A:  No, not at all.   
1 SESAME STREET, but, uh,
1 A:  Sort of like lawyers, you know [laughter].   
0 B:  I mean in Dallas they do.   
0 A:  And for I don't know, it much have been two or three weeks there, they were
0 somebody but after you've seen them,
1 A:  Oh, well, there goes a patriot missile, oh, well, that's good,
1 A:  and I w-, and I worked in intelligence.   
0 A:  I mean they've poured billions of dollars into this stuff but the stupid
1 crying} oh, this is so terrible, I just, I don't what we're going to do.
0 A:  Yeah, uh, yeah, just kind of, it's kind of a ((kluge)) that was pieced
0 B:  Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  I bet that's a pretty nice setup.   
0 used to call it.  It's, uh, I used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Yes.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Right, right.   
1 A:  But now that we have children and we go every blue moon,
1 particular [laughter],
0 really just camp.  You know, they love to go camping.
0 single weekend,
1 A:  ((I haven't)) really as far as entertainment, I don't know what you would
0 B:  yeah. 
1 A:  Because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles, you know
1 them in grocery bags.  So, we have, we leave three little piles,
0 A:  Well, that would be a help.  I wish they would do that here.  We have got
0 A:  and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags,
1 A:  Here they don't want your rotted tomatoes.   
1 have the bag for the newspapers,
0 B:  I understand, uh, my husband about once a weekend he'll go, uh, to a couple
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
1 refuse.  It would have to be cut into four-foot lengths.
0 they're recycling them into other plastics.
0 B:  And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like that and I think
0 B:  Right.   
0 B:  that if everybody, uh, and so, yeah, I know like our cafeteria here uses
1 Styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or, uh, china cups to use up our
1 water [laughter].
1 A:  But at the moment we're using the china cups, 
0 call it the term, civil, uh, suits as it were or even some corporate, uh, law.
0 A:  Um, what do you think about the aspect of unanimous jury?  When they do
0 with, the judge could render a decision much quicker, uh, and you'd, you'd
1 once we got them through your courts but, uh,
1 A:  Certainly makes sense because,  
1 A:  some of this stuff is, you know, y-, you're just doing this to do this,
1 you know [laughter].
0 A:  to, uh, doing what they call more of a family court where he gets to go
1 A:  couples get kind of spiteful at times and,   
0 B:  Yeah, I mean because seems like I don't know, I mean, there's so many
1 duty.
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 A:  And I said well, me being from the electronics industry I'll bite, why?
0 technically minded and be very absorbed with what their field is, and they
1 A:  And I said well, that, that's quite possible I said I've discussed,
1 little realm, uh,
1 A:  Right.   
1 been asleep for five years,
0 A:  but, uh, the Russian economy they, you know, they, I don't know what the
0 B:  {Very faint} Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
0 the, the economic, well, the, uh, the social structure of the Soviet Union,
0 friends have a taken us down, the stance of, you know, these people are just
0 for that.
1 places,
0 traditionally known as Russia and then all these little nationality groups,
0 know, they had some real fancy names for them.
0 B:  as a separate country, you know,  
1 forty-eight, you know.
1 B:  Oh, I just read for escape.   
1 magazines either.
0 B:  Have you, are you a Civil War buff at all? 
0 A:  ((BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM)). 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  yeah, I'm glad you put it that way.   
0 okay.
1 wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, Texas participation in the Civil War was, uh, minor at, uh,
0 the Midwest which,
0 A:  It sounds like Iowa or something.   
0 A:  Uh-huh.    
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
0 B:  I mean, I think I've read all four of them and I understand that there's a
0 fifth.

0 B:  It was, it was beyond, uh,
1 B:  what they were talking about, 
0 B:  It's just that if you're ever, ever really want to just be scared out of

1 A:  They put it on their french fries, they'll put it in their potato salad,
0 B:  you know, we don't go out to eat that much.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  But, um,  
0 A:  so we're very, you know, we try to be very environmental and,
0 A:  You know, yeah so, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Yep.  
0 A:  Oh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.

1 B:  No.  
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter] Not since they're coach is ((gone)).  
0 biggest problem is,
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah, right.  
1 A:  Right.  
0 A:  played thirty-four games this year.  That's almost half,

0 A:  I don't know.  
0 B:  Yep.  
1 A:  Yeah, uh, somebody took the fire out from under them.  
0 B:  Yeah, but then, you know, it could be, what if they're not hitting that
0 B:  Yeah.   
0 well, L A -s going to come down there and beat up on Texas, you know,
1 A:  Sure.  
1 A:  Ever since Akeem changed his, uh, first name to Hakeem. 
1 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  Port-, Portland's looking awful good.  
0 Jordan, but they never did seem to make an impact on the playoffs.
0 B:  I think,  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  I can, I can see that happening.  
1 [laughter].
1 A:  And they all have to have the same one, you know.  And,
0 B: [Laughter] I can see how them kids and not letting them watch T V and

1 B:  They were into Michael Jackson [laughter].

0 A:  No, huh-uh, because I'm like forty-three.  
0 that, uh, it's going to give us a chance for peace over there?
1 B:  Well, well, you don't find many intelligent people starting wars.

1 B:  Yeah.  They shouldn't leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet.
0 A:  [Laughter] So, do you think it's, you do think it's a good idea for us
1 different over here.
1 B:  Okay [laughter].  Good deal.
1 A:  -- and said don't ever, 
1 everything (( )).
1 probably have another sandstorm out there, you know.
0 B:  I see, okay.  
1 A:  Hadn't had one like that in a couple of years.

0 Lubbock, but still,
0 then I went to work for T I here --
0 B:  Right.  
1 that was like going home.

0 A:  I've got some out here that's five, six years old now and still doesn't
0 B:  #That it's worth planting, huh.#
0 A:  -- they seem to or just Yaupons, period, seem to do all right.
1 that's,
0 A:  Well, are you, you with T I? 
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  So.  
0 going to talk about something about the weather, they'd have tried to --
1 B:  Exactly [laughter].  
0 B:  Clear across town.  
1 shining and it would be hot down in the, 
1 on the, uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion
1 little touchy [throat_clearing] every now and then about that [laughter].
1 think we should be a little more circumspect about it.  Again, my opinion
1 A:  I think so [laughter].  
0 B:  Uh, I don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas, but, you know, it seems
1 B:  Whole state.  
0 B:  I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience
0 contradict himself,
1 A:  Yeah.  It really did.  
0 A:  We're looking at buying a house, 
0 A:  Well, we just started two or three weeks ago.  
0 B:  That's pretty excellent.  
0 B:  Do you really, because that's, I work with Elma.  
1 B:  Unfortunately. 
1 A:  It, they speak with forked tongue, don't they.  
1 A:  Yes.  That's true.  It doesn't seem to workout that way, though does it
0 B:  Huh-uh.  
0 A:  (( )). 
1 B:  Huh-uh.  [laughter].  
0 B:  Huh-uh.  
1 A:  Huh-uh.  
1 B:  No.  Never been in New York [laughter].  
1 B:  I don't want to go there [laughter].  
1 B:  Thirty-one.  You're, you're young [laughter].  
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  Seems kind of old to me.  
0 B:  uh, older people, or they think they're far enough away from something,
0 B:  Something is coming out, #yeah.#  
0 else.  We end up paying for it again.  Now we're going to end up paying for it
0 A:  Huh-uh.  
1 It's helped me to think more about some issues that I need to be thinking more
0 B:  So,
0 @@B:  Well, you, too.  
1 B:  Okay.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah, 
1 B:  You live in Pennsylvania?  [Laughter].  
0 B:  I didn't know they did this.  
0 B:  Yeah.  I'm down here at T I.  
1 tent camping, and we had access to a motor home which is really super great,
0 when the children were smaller we used to go to, uh, Delaware along the o-,
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  That's kind of, kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 to pretty much hike out most of the time.
1 B:  Yeah, the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary but, uh, 
0 B:  Well, it's good to get out and smell some fresh air, too.   
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.  
1 A:  Oh, they do, too.  
1 size, you know.  If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you
1 B:  Yeah.  That's true.  And they won't raise our taxes.  
1 A:  Ha-ha  [laughter].  
0 B:  of mine told me about this program, is the reason that I'm,
0 was crushers out in all of the hallways you know, and that's, they use the
0 hard sometimes to watch T V during the night, but I usually try to catch the
0 A:  those type of (( )). I have to say, during the war we're, the American
1 the best resource,
1 A:  Uh, I don't think much of their sports coverage.  
1 B:  Um, but you need to continue to read, so you people learn to read, you
0 well, I remember one time up in Nashville, Tennessee.  One of the fellows got
0 B:  Ouch.  Everybody got excited.  
1 B:  Really I just got mine in the mail so, it kind of sparked me to keep
1 A:  Barney Fife, I guess.  
0 B:  And all those guys.  
0 A:  JOHNNIE QUEST.  (( )) the good ones.  
1 recognizing what was going on, I thought, this isn't really very good

1 somebody about gun control.
0 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  but, but for killing people.  
1 get it done.
1 B:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's bad.  And, and well, in certain parts of town it's
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Yeah. That's, that's just ridiculous, you know [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  lock my door [laughter].  
1 A:  I don't care if there's a red light.  
1 There's a saying down here, all roads lead to south Dallas when you get lost

1 the window and he'd watch a policeman chase someone down the sidewalk.
1 A:  other than maybe a butcher knife,  
0 B:  Oh, my.  
0 A:  And I can very well see his point.  
1 B:  and antique weapons.  (( )) he can shoot a muzzle loader real good.
0 that, it bothers, it would make me really nervous to have a gun in the house.
1 gun.  And to this day they declare that the gun was not loaded.
1 A:  I'm just like, well, then, where did his stomach go, you know,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Oh I see [laughter].
0 medicine, so I can go out and go, uh, deep sea fishing.  Now, that would be
0 A:  Well, I was raised on the Texas gulf coast,
1 A:  I would love to do that, but they have snakes over there,
1 A:  I'd make some quick arrangements --
1 A:  I would be impressed [laughter].  
0 that region.
0 what your talking about.  Because I was just wondering, we went to Galveston
0 A:  I didn't realize that had happened,
1 A:  I've seen what comes out of the ocean, and I have no desire to share,
1 hotels with,
1 for you if you like the air condition type.
0 up in the mountains, and I guess I live about five hours away, from some place
1 their back,
0 usually, lots and lots of ponds, particularly (( )) uh, for canoeing, and, you
0 wasn't just the,
1 blew down, and,
1 you know, really so much the, uh, the normal every day,
1 then too much,
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 haven't been in a movie since [laughter],
0 B:  I mean, fifteen bucks to go see a movie with -- 
0 want to go see --
0 A:  -- and, uh, so then when something comes up they'll usually stay on a while
0 semi-horror type stuff, you know.
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 uh,
1 B:  -- and it, and then you leave the movie, like, with your brain, you got a
0 --
0 I think North Carolina's going to do pretty.  I think they'll go to the
0 A:  They creamed Indiana.  
1 A:  -- amateur team ever.
1 A:  Yeah, big time.  
1 A:  I, I'll bet they could hold their own in the N B A. 
1 A:  Possibly.  
0 time, you might have an upset.
1 call it the, uh, the U C L A invitational,
0 leave college before they turn seniors.
0 who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they don't participate
1 A:  -- uh, certainly, you know, there could be advantages and things to be
0 A:  -- but on the other hand, you know, how do you enforce it or what if they
0 forced to do something that they don't want to do.
0 reasonable.
0 B:  Yeah.  When I was in college I worked, uh, with a group and I actually ran
0 be relying on them for something, uh, you know, depending on them to either be
0 choice.  And things that, uh, you know, the problem is that now it's seen as
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 and twenty-one.  The numbers keep changing so it's hard for me to remember
1 like that.
0 A:  So you don't get a chance to, to spend much time with him, then, until when
0 A:  Wow.   
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah, they sure --  
1 and then they start saying, no, so [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] It can be pretty sudden, too.   
0 A:  [Laughter]  Well, I, it's not sudden, it's just that it probably doesn't
1 A:  Because you ex-, --  
1 or five months tops.  After that, you're in the house [laughter],
1 A:  But I wouldn't sleep on the ground.  I went into a hotel [laughter].
0 B:  Petting zoos and things.   
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 the mother turned around and saw me and took the kid away, you know,
1 [laughter] pulled the kid,
0 A:  Uh-huh.   
1 A:  Yeah, well, she was close, but, yet whenever I wanted to do something,
1 B:  I don't know if that relates to that or not but,    
0 B:  My oldest.   
1 B:  -- but, he'd really kind of well up and be ready to cry over there.
1 he wanted to put it in the bathtub so,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter] She told him no he couldn't do it,
0 B:  Uh-huh.   
1 A:  -- uh, we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool
1 [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.   
1 friend the fish that I caught [laughter].
0 that, again, just people are taxed --
0 A:  -- you know.  What do you feel about it?
0 B:  -- you know, it's worthwhile to itemize --
0 is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with, you know
1 A:  Oh, I know, like I said, everyone's been in from Texas.
1 them happen,
1 B:  It's funny that those are my two, my husband's two favorite shows, too,
1 so much and I'm involved with the characters, but,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Probably, yeah --
1 B:  Yeah, I think we've covered our time.
0 this is a change.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  The what, the POST?
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  I don't, I don't regularly watch news or a newspaper.  I would say I get
0 there's a war going on.  Oh, okay [laughter].
0 the country vote the way they do --
0 A:  I probably do watch more T V because I get home, and in between say,
1 A:  -- because by ten thirty I start to fade.
0 A:  Yeah, I remember when I was in school.
0 B:  -- and then that night, it wouldn't need one, you know, because she would
0 A:  Yeah, that would seem like that would be more expensive than a, uh, nursing
0 aide, they don't pay them enough to keep him there and to do the things that
0 B:  Huh-uh.  It's get bad, it is, nursing home I think is sometimes I think
0 one day, and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them.
0 B:  You know, they can't really defend themselves like somebody, uh, say my
0 times more.
1 way through college, and then, uh, kind of hung them up after college, but,
1 hard Mets fan,
1 B:  I never fou-, I never quite found a New York fan.
1 know, um, I'm sort of glad Strawberry went away.
1 B:  -- when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner (( )).
0 B:  That's right, so.
1 A:  -- but there's like two fellows from, uh, Brooklyn,
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, well I guess they were, uh, I guess they must have been scared
1 A:  No, not really, they were pretty much thugs, they weren't scared very much,
1 B:  Well, that's good, well, they're Brooklyn boys, I guess.
0 A:  Really.
1 but these two were definitely thugs, and they were from Brooklyn [laughter].
0 the Rangers though.  They're, uh, they're, they're they, they have, I think
1 A:  I love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium.  It's great.
0 B:  [Laughter] Well, that, that's actually, I think I make something, because
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario.  
1 B:  Actually whoever built the city was an idiot, in my opinion,
0 A:  Yeah.
1 go, uh, they'll go fly.
1 B:  Yes, it's true.
1 just go into their skid about, you know, the end of June.
0 B:  Well, the way I, the way I see it, is, I mean, um, you know, I can use a
1 B:  Yeah, well it takes me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium.
0 B:  Oh Toronto's only about two hours, yeah.
1 in the high fifties today, but three and a half weeks ago, we had an ice storm
0 A:  Huh, illegal,
0 B:  Oh, okay.
1 get into basketball.  We even have peewee basketball here.
1 B:  Have, have you been out of the country?
0 B: # Oh, okay.  So,# but um, now, I don't know, but um, but let's see, when I was
0 made, like go skiing in Vermont or something.
1 B:  But, what happens is we used to fight a lot, so there's never much of a
0 A:  Problem, uh-huh
0 B:  But, you know, like, four, I mean fou-, four children is expensive,
0 B:  Yeah, I know, and that's, that's what happened to my brother.  He came to
0 interested.  Well, at least for a year and a half --
1 A:  No, I don't want to get that cold now [laughter].
1 [laughter].
0 it, but when it gets hot like this --
1 B:  No.
0 A:  Wait a while, it'll change.
0 classics,

0 A:  [Laughter] That's,

0 A:  I thought that was, do you like Michener at all?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 TRAIL OF THE SPANISH BIT is the first,

1 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].
0 economic one.
0 the history of violent crime?
0 victimized, what do you do about it?
0 degree murder or, uh,
0 has probably really changed, you know, my thinking on this.
1 in a state that absolutely did not allow it --
0 A:  My house is on a main road, and it has nothing [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans.  I guess it's,

0 lilac tree, and the landlord cut it down and said, Yeah, that's one thing you

1 in big trouble,
1 birthday party and a war started in Israel [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, we talked.

1 A:  I know it but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city, believe it or
1 not [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh, very much.  When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change,
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh, I didn't know that about Burlington, I'll have to keep that in

1 B:  I guess, four years.  Yeah, yeah.  It, uh, quite a different world isn't
0 B:  Right.  So, uh, but I, I feel that, uh, a lot of people have gotten lazy

0 A:  Yeah.
0 blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is
0 B:  We've actually, uh, uh, tried, uh, budgeting is very important to us.  We,
0 we try it every month, and, um, I think it's good, I mean, it gives us a sense
1 A:  We, we pay a percentage, um, which is kind of strange, [laughter] --
0 that's always the killer, um --
0 B:  So we, I mean, we do, uh, when, you know, whenever we go through the
1 don't have any control over it --
1 A:  -- to, you know, you can't keep up with it, and it really gets you in
1 B:  -- and do all those fun things, and, uh, I think, I think we'd be totally
1 bankrupt [laughter] --
1 what we prove to ourselves every month, is that we're spending more than we
1 possible to live beyond our [/noise] means --
1 A:  Right, well, that's good [laughter].
0 A:  I know what you mean about the school, because that's what I'm trying to
1 B:  We're going, we're going through the exact same thing. 
0 A:  -- you know.  It's, it's not easy to do [laughter].
0 A:  -- but --
0 B:  And so, the only way to get out from under that is to, is to do some kind
1 are grown up and they, they want to do things like go to college --
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 being totally brilliant, though, though they are --
1 B:  -- but you can't count on them totally brilliant --
1 B:  -- right, right --
1 A:  Right, right, [laughter] That's the way you have to do it, right.  No
0 when they get an allowance, uh, part of that's supposed to go to savings, for

0 B:  So are you a freshwater or,
0 A:  [Laughter] You didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people
0 B:  No, no, no, I love shark steak, but, uh, the ones I caught were never large
1 A:  Uh, no I haven't.  I don't know that I could do that.  That looks awful
1 tiring [laughter].
1 B:  -- no.  
1 A:  Catching tree bass, right [laughter].
1 A:  Did you [laughter].
0 A:  So do you, do you fish mainly for trophies or do you, do you eat what you
1 B:  Well, I'm a fisher [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter] You just like to sit down and watch it, right.
0 B:  -- and do either, again, bottom fishing or --
0 A:  That's nice.
0 A:  Well, most of my fishing is done at, um, area lakes around here, freshwater
1 working with my freshwater tackle.  That was real fun.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 really about it.  Mostly just the lakes around here, and I fish to take home
1 and cook [laughter].
1 something home.
1 who did not catch,
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  -- my daughter caught fish, his daughter caught fish,
1 snappers except guess who.
1 A:  [Laughter] It had to be you.
1 B:  That's right, I would go from one side of the boat to the other, and, uh,
1 even he started baiting my hook [laughter],

0 everything to where, if they've got one typographical error where in their, in

0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh, that's it.
1 out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, oh, gosh, you can ride a
0 A:  organization.  For me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, you

0 B:  Huh.
1 day was through.

0 we're, you know, uh, and we have a nine and a half year old son, and it's
0 loans.  We're still paying --
0 think we have about thirteen months left on it.
0 A:  And after that, we either, what we want to do is begin doubling up our car

1 B:  That may not be a bad idea.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, our, our limit is, you know, fairly low --

0 A:  Oh, okay, well, that's, that's neat.
1 making a judgment here that may or may, I think it is totally wrong, well.
1 B:  Um?  What do they have to do with one another?
1 B:  Yeah, there is.  There are much easier ways to get out of jury duty.

0 large voter turnout.
0 A:  But, I've heard so many statements that I've lost track.
0 B:  So, how do you think we can get people to vote?  [laughter].
1 A:  -- a dollar bill comes out the bottom.

0 B:  Oh, right.
0 A:  -- the trees, you know, what the,
1 A:  And, you know, the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties,
1 A:  When it got down in the sixties you were cold down there [laughter].

0 B:  So I, I,
0 the verdict was, but I thought that they all had to agree or else they, it was
0 A:  Yeah, I,
0 B:  Sure, they should have them go out and doing stuff.
1 A:  Jim.  Sorry about that.  Do you have any pets?
0 A:  Well, we've got, we've got a cat, and this is a very, very special cat

1 yard at night before we went to play badminton [laughter].
1 clean clothes, you know, every day [laughter].
1 B:  You know, with a dog,
1 B:  bringing a dog on the job,
0 she's got six or seven cats, and one of her cats, somehow or other must have
1 our cat's food dish is, and he likes our food a lot better than he likes hers,
1 right off and put him back out again.
1 the back, so he runs around the back, then I go in the front door.
0 it intentionally, I, and if I'm in the house already.  Sometimes I can keep
0 just kind of put my foot out, uh, against his neck while I'm, I'm trying to,
1 shot,
1 A:  he likes our food best.
0 tonight, you know, just a nice blouse, and if I had to wear it with a suit or
1 B:  When it comes to winter though, my, my goal is to stay warm,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 A:  All the girls that I know, I know a couple girls that work in insurance
0 would love a job where I didn't, I wouldn't be casual all the time, but I
0 and the smock would be too much.  It gets really hot.
1 B:  Yeah, I know.
1 A:  I would be one of the women in flats [laughter].
0 ball of my foot, hope that I --
0 B:  Okay?
1 A:  -- drags on forever.
1 A:  Cause I, I mean, I don't know, it's just something, I think, something we
1 here like, um, three or four times a night on various cable channels
0 B:  I've probably seen every episode about thirty-five times [laughter].
1 [laughter], 
1 two drama shows that I like.  And I tell everybody, don't call me (( ))

0 A:  Well, that, that, that, I guess from the, from the card issuer, uh, that
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 around, and, and, uh, I don't even carry checks around.  I let my wife take
0 B:  Schedule A or,
0 check if you're out of state, and,
0 A:  They don't allow, they don't do tha-,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:   [beep] Well, I, I don't think that it's, it's wrong for a
0 B:   You know.   
0 B:   Oh, I see.  So, do you ... 
0 B:   -- and I've been drug tested three times and I know many
0 as much.  
0 A:   But, but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those
0 bought a lot of cars, a lot of the same kind of cars, what ended up he
1 eventually had his own private junkyard, which is terrible to look at,
1 do you.
0 that have been wrecked or, uh, salvaged.  They p-, they might have been stolen
0 A:  And they didn't really know.  It was a real nice late model car, real
0 B:  Huh.
0 A:  -- and I was impressed.  I really liked it.  
0 help me out, I would even think about buying something like a Ford Taurus, as

1 A:  So, it, it's amazing, even when you abuse them.  
1 roads and I was ruining the car, so I sold it,
0 down south for high school I was just repeating what I'd already done.
0 that specializes in science or art.  You know, there's no point in, you know,

1 A:  Yeah, maybe the, maybe they'll bring their good schools with them.
1 getting cut back, and you're getting --
0 we're in a recession here.  We, uh, our town didn't pass the school budget
0 are in the recession and they're, even though we've, uh, enjoyed very good
0 in the past.  In, uh, some places, uh, you couldn't go to a public school.  It
0 B:  I, I don't think I'm getting what I should, but, you know, in Texas, it's
0 B:  -- but that's, I don't know, I think it just builds on the foundation that
0 A:  So you have to go to a lesser engineering school.  We have a very good
0 school.  It's, it's University of Vermont.  Uh, we also have some two year
1 B:  Okay [laughter].  
0 B:  What kind of hobbies do you have?  
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah.  
0 A:  -- that sort of stuff.  And dancing.  
1 B:  That's like a hobby, because I don't ever make anybody nothing but me
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  And then I go ballooning.  
0 B:  Hot ai-,

0 A:  THE WATCHERS, you know, they made a movie of THE WATCHERS, here not too
0 long ago --

1 B:  I don't like, I don't like scary books [laughter].  
0 B:  CHAN-,
1 day to see if I could, so I can watch the movie [laughter].
0 B:  It was good.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  I've always tried to do that.  
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  I like it better than aerobics.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah, well, it's so neat because it's right there and I can go just right
0 B:  I don't know.  
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  But I always ask him how come they don't ever have no hair.  Because
0 B:  Yeah.  They do.  
1 B:  I told him, I said, well, if you do it, you can't shave your hair.
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 know, if, if, if there, if you killed the person and it's like, oops, too bad.
0 A:  And they really, their parents don't bring them up properly.  They have
0 B:  I don't think that anyone that, uh, commits a murder actually thinks that
0 He, he acted like he didn't even think that this was going to kill her.  The
0 kids were really quite ignorant about it and it, it was a tragedy on both
0 family.  Oh, this guys nice to me, he doesn't hit me [laughter].
1 B:  They're not my favorite team.  
0 A:  And, uh, uh, what do you think Milwaukee's going to do this year?
0 B:  Well, uh, [laughter] I don't think they're going to challenge for the lead
0 A:  Sort of a building seas-, season.  
0 B:  Well, there's been some talk that they're going to trade Pete Incaviglia.
1 truth to that, but you never can tell.
1 I'm real nice to him he's going, 
0 B:  I see.  
0 A:  Yeah, but, I don't know. 
0 A:  Right.  Right.  Sounds like they have a young guy, that they're putting a

1 B:  Right, somewhere else.  
0 A:  [Laughter] That's right.  
0 B:  -- paying, they ought to get, they ought to get the performance out of
0 person --
0 A:  Oh, jeez.  
1 out, they fizzle.
0 B:  Well, I think it will be fun.  I'm ready for baseball season to start.
0 uh, we'll just have to watch and see how it goes, comes about.
0 dollars back, fifteen, twenty, whatever I could spare, I was putting back in a
0 B:  Uh, well, they, we have direct deposit.  That helps a lot.  
0 it's, uh, you know, that's extra, uh, but, he's got us situated to where we
1 the, uh, on the clipboard.
0 B:  Yeah, I just k-, I just think that I, it would help a lot if I got a job,
0 A:  Well, Bonny, it sounds like a pretty good idea.  
0 were I guess, other leaders were still crazier about it, you know, like other
0 A:  -- using it.  But, yet the, 
1 A:  Right, I don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet.  
1 B:  Uh [laughter], no.  
0 within their own borders they feel freer to do --
0 believe in war.  That's my thing.  I don't believe that anybody should die --
0 A:  Right, right.  
0 know there are benefits to the metric system, I don't think the benefits of
0 B:  -- back and forth and it was not hard and you get, you can get a CAT CAM
0 think it should still be taught in schools.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  It may be arrogant, but I mean, let them come to us [laughter].  
1 A:  That's funny.  Well, that's good.  I think we kept it at real good.
1 Lithuania, and we were talking about something tot-, income tax or something.
0 A:  [Talking] Okay.  So, uh, then, do you keep kids?  Is this two year old
1 A:  I know.
0 A:  #Have# you been able to do that all along or,
0 know, you really can't know everything --
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  #Well, you know, I work# eight to five thirty so what am I supposed to do
0 Tuesday.  They had a Mother's Day Out that my baby-sitter took them to, you
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 #[laughter],#
0 A:  -- you know, but I'd like them to be able to say, gee, God made the
0 going there and i-, I love it.  #I have been at# --
0 A:  -- the cost was not near as much as the Kindercares [/printer] were going
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- #and that's hard.#
0 A:  -- #peace of mind also.#
1 Remind me of that now that you mention it #[laughter].#
0 A:  A Mazda.  How come you got a Mazda?  
0 trade off the Super cab and I'm considering going with either one of those
0 A:  Well, those small ones, uh, those little bitty ones, I'm going to go with
0 A:  But, that's what they don't show you when they get, you know, when they get
0 B:  Huh?  
0 A:  He just, he just lives out there, he makes his living on the road out
0 B:  Yeah, I wanted to get a Mustang, I wanted to get a convertible, but the
0 B:  Yeah and you tack on the insurance they can add to it because insurance,
1 thousand.  It would be about sixty thousand down there [laughter],
0 B:  And so there's quite a difference there.  
1 B:  So they were shooting themselves in the foot,
0 B:  Uh, in Texas I was, oh, I believe the, uh, t-, sales tax was somewhere
1 And I have five children so,
0 paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school.  It just, you
0 [laughter] in a sense.  I guess the, you know, the idea is that, uh, the more
0 people you have in the family, the more allowances you need, you know, the
0 if, uh, you know, if we're going to do that, then we ought to really get some
0 dependents you have, you know, the allowances you get and, uh, the more you
1 it on the fifteenth.  So we'll see [laughter].
1 that one day,
1 B:  That's right [laughter].  
0 B:  -- as I see them towards him or towards my mother with certain things --
0 husband more because he doesn't do [laughter] certain things --
1 of decisions on her own yet.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  And you don't feel that your relationship with your father has
0 there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost, he,
0 A:  -- and so that's how old our friends are and they're on their second
1 A:  Right.  And that was back in nineteen fifty-nine.  
0 A:  -- uh, first of all we have a source now.  We got a, a friend whose a 
1 B:  Well, that's great.  
1 A:  But they don't put salt on the roads down there, then?  
1 B:  [Laughter] They sand the roads and it just turns into a big mess
0 B:  So, uh, but really, the, when it, when it gets uh, nasty down here it's
1 to get rid of this thing because there's no way we can haul kids and junk and
0 just put it in home and let it go there and take me there.
0 B:  Uh, oh, yeah, but yeah, uh, that's not one of my first priorities when I'm
0 A:  -- uh, because we used to go, we, we, we, uh, built our home and we built
1 A:  -- for the work I was doing around.  But now everything's done so,
1 B:  When it gets to be a hundred degrees every day for a month and a half
1 A:  -- when I left here and we're down to the thirties and twenties and,
0 you, you just can't sell a car down here that does not have air-conditioning
1 not have air-conditioning and we went through one summer that way and that was
0 almost brand new, the, the gentlemen who owned it had died --
0 B:  Ooh wee [laughter].  
0 eighty-four Parisian Pontiac --
1 grass coming up, and I thought, ooh, we've got to start this mowing bit soon
1 B:  Yeah.  But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it's gray
0 [laughter].
0 B:  Well, I like it when it's sort of a medium temperature, uh, maybe
0 B:  -- it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the, the late
0 A:  I, you know, I was going into the grocery store, and a, a lightening bolt
1 A:  Not too challenging to the brain.
0 weeks ago with the guys here.  I work at T I.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  I finally got out, and I've been watching quite a few videos.  I had not
0 been able to play so I took out a few videos and watched them for a while, and
0 getting out, being in the outdoors, and I'm a hunter and fisher anyway, but,
0 A:  -- you don't want to go out and get beat to death, but.
0 you play with the same people, you, you aren't going to learn anything.
0 B:  But, uh, I'd like to, uh, eventually I'd like to work up, if, if my wife
0 get better, and you just keep going, and in the meantime, just enjoy what
1 A:  Hi, how are you doing?
0 B:  Yes, yes we do, right here at the, at the very building, they have a
0 B:  Uh, when the public whole is at stake --
0 but for myself, I'm willing to say, okay, you know, uh, if I see this is a
0 to save us all money [noise] as far as benefits and everything else --
0 A:  -- I've never said that I didn't want that.  The problem that I had was,
0 A:  -- #that they# were doing that.  I know that they were --
0 discounts --
0 studies that show that if you're smoking you're not, you're not as, you know,
1 do you like French fries?
1 B:  I do [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, I'd probably get upset.
0 A:  Um.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  It's the honor system, isn't it.
0 A:  -- if you think about it --
1 you know, a lot of times it's a [clicking] --
1 A:  Right, right, yeah.
0 A:  Um, [clicking] where it's not so-, I don't think people that [/clicking]
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Well, I, I, I do, I do make that statement.  I say I do it because I like
1 B:  Nicotine addiction, yeah.
0 numerous times --
0 they go to a, [beep] a friend's house or something and there they're all
0 A:  Start up again.
1 B:  Well, I can tell you're from, you've got that New England accent.

1 A:  If I walk, it will be ten degrees warmer, but it will last twenty minutes.
1 for sure at that point.
0 B:  Oh, that just feels like it goes all the way to the bone.

0 the heads of state obviously, you know --
0 A:  Oh, yeah.

0 of shading --
1 really hard.  But I really do en-, like I said I really enjoy it when I do.
0 B:  Do you, do you use patterns, I mean, like a book of patterns, or do you go
1 how much they,
1 replace the water pump back in nineteen eighty-three.
0 A:  But if any major problems, say, like, uh, transmission leaks, I took it in
1 A:  Namely, uh, re-, putting the catalytic converter back on the car --
0 B:  And sure enough, after I'd taken it home for a couple of weeks after that,
1 bought a Ford Escort [laughter].
1 uh, cause me to le-, huh.
1 B:  He doesn't really have anything else to spend his money on [laughter].
1 B:  -- to get his oil changed.  I'm going, I don't think that's worth it

0 A:  Yeah. It's in great shape.  Body is in excellent shape.  It just needs
0 look at?
0 A:  Right.
1 something cents interest,
1 B:  But, uh, for hotels and, and so forth.  But, uh, but I knew that it was

1 [laughter],
0 A:  to pay it in ad-, you know, in advance before we spend it, but, I guess
0 A:  Oh really.
0 B:  So, now, the only time that got to be a problem was, if the exchange rate
0 started planning the trip, I think, uh, a dollar was worth nine or ten 
1 or three francs to the dollar.  So the [laughter],
0 A:  Right.
1 A:  Right. Yeah especially, 
0 B:  But as I said, most, most of all I try not to use them, uh, to any, you

0 B:  The, the wide open, the spaces,

0 I think.  Uh, Like Chevron has just recently dropped theirs back.
1 price back to the cash price or raised all their prices,

0 A:  #Uh,#

1 A:  No.  None whatsoever #[laughter].#
1 A:  [Laughter] Obviously you have kids.
0 A:  Um, the last movie I saw was, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. 
1 B:  Right.
1 while afterwards.  So [laughter],

0 B:  Right.
1 A:  -- you ought to make it at least semi-,

1 miss it, for a week or two.  You feel kind of left out [laughter].
0 A:  That's right.  I, uh, when I first moved down here, moved into the
1 A:  Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V, you know.
0 B:  Right.
0 watch cartoons and stuff.
0 B:  Second of all, why the networks think that, you know, we enjoy that kind of
1 dramatically [laughter] or something.
1 that's the, I feel the exact same way.
1 are even involved in the show.
0 A:  You know, why do you do this to yourself?
0 B:  So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program.
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 that suffices me.  But,
1 A:  In fact, it's, I think it's on tonight [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah, we try to stay up, too [laughter].  
0 lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything.
0 had, when we sent temporaries to T I, we had to have their drug tested.
0 B:  Yeah, some of the stories you read about cocaine, that's like people try it
0 and then they start a drug problem.
0 A:  Yeah, I know, I'm glad of that.  And I have, knock wood, pretty good luck,
1 A:  No, no, I don't care about that, she'll be on the phone all night.
0 B:  -- that's best way to avoid trouble, from what I can gather.
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah, I think that's a really good thing to encourage.

0 or not, and they tell me that's going to catch up with me someday.
1 up on occasion.
1 A:  -- and twenty years old, and I was just this little toothpick up there.
1 A:  Had to buy a new suit for it, just to fit in there.
0 A:  It's unfortunate though, I guess, because I probably should do a little
1 bigger than me, for the most part.
0 A:  It's not all sitting behind a desk, so that's kind of nice.  It, uh, I
0 could sure tell the difference though after the first year or so of being
0 A:  those ten speeds and their unforgiving seat that I sit on, but they tend
1 way back up.
1 push along the way,
0 my fiancee has two kids --
1 B:  -- so we need a car that's big enough for six.
0 B:  -- for two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they
0 A:  -- and he got a demo.
0 B:  -- and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can
0 on to the one I've got for a few years because it's, it's, it's almost four
0 B:  Oh yeah.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Eventually.
0 B:  {Pause} But, uh, {pause} my car is using two quarts of oil a week now.
0 B:  -- to keep the monthly payment low.
0 B:  Okay, did, did you use it at the car shop place.
0 dealers participated in the, in the fleet program,
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  -- and offered them the same price as what I knew I was going to be able to
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Well, Dana, it's been really interesting, I appreciate talking with you.
0 times to know who was speaking.  They also talked on top of each other a lot.
1 A:  Yeah, and then, oh, they do ride nice, too.
0 A:  Oh really?
1 A:  So I just walked across the street and bought a car [laughter] --
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah, got to see them all the time.

1 A:  That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?  [laughter]. 
1 A:  Well, this should be very interesting,
0 A:  And you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way.
0 A:  [Breathing] and they don't have a waiting period, [breathing] because they

0 um, what his ideals are,
0 more blatant about it, but it's very secret, and it's been going on for years.
0 I mean, you can't [breathing] change things overnight.
1 A:  It seems to be headed in that direction too.
0 people have that's when you tend to realize, you know, [breathing] what's out

0 B:  that when they make like, you know, sixty cents,
1 B:  I don't know what to do about it.
0 B:  Yeah.  And then too, I think that, you know, I think a lot of women who
0 you know, in, in things but I know a lot that don't so,
0 A:  #in some type# of a day-care or something because so many women work now.
1 B:  But, uh, I guess, as long as you are single, you have to support yourself
0 don't know any statistics on, you know, how many women run for public office.
0 A:  a long time to, to get up to the pay scales of the white man, and now I
0 B:  Yeah.  I think we will see a black, a Black man as president before we see
0 B:  And, uh, like I said, I really have [laughter] no interest in politics,
0 A:  and, and the men basically see a business woman and ask them to go get
1 coffee or something.
0 B:  The, it's, it just not, doesn't work [laughter].  
1 A:  Oh, yes, yes, #this is true.#  
0 B:  Yeah, and how [swallowing] many people lost money on that, lost money in

0 B:  and where's, where is that going to come from?
0 B:  Oh well you don't pay, we, we, keep full coverage down here on everything.
1 B:  Because well it's not, it's not that bad.  But that's getting off the
0 A:  But, you get, you get into when you start getting them to do things, you
0 A:  So what we get is so garbled that who knows if we even have the ability to
0 B:  #I can see why.# 
0 A:  #Well,#
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 this ((type)) [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah. 
1 A:  [Laughter] You know, the money was the issue.

1 [laughter],
0 B:  Yeah, we have a dog too so that adds to it --
1 B:  Oh, yeah, because Houston was really hurricane alley, wasn't it,

0 A:  I think they said forty-one had been shot out of one church in the last
0 B:  Ye-, if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death, then

0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  so, uh, uh, you know he enjoys that but, uh, um, I, [laughter].
0 A:  Like I said, T V isn't my best subject because, 
1 [laughter] about this subject.
1 A:  [Laughter] Uh, yes.
0 A:  And less than that in local elections.
0 A:  -- you know, on the, on the issues, rather than just voting blindly, you
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  That, that surprises me too.  
0 A:  you know, if you don't, [laughter] if you don't participate in it.  I

1 A:  And it looked awful on [laughter]. 
1 A:  This was a, and it was a major project getting the money together

1 B:  Oh, boy.  
1 B:  Well, I don't recall my parents having that much trouble [laughter].
0 back, I mean,
0 B:  But, still,
1 A:  Well, maybe there are some professionals out there [laughter].
0 A:  uh, for all that.  
0 Chico's and one new place, uh, that's pretty good is uh, Pappasito's, so when

1 B:  Well, I hadn't read it and I couldn't figure what was going on #half the
1 what is this?
0 B:  [/Noise] Oh, that is, that is the most precious movie.  It has, w-, to see
0 B:  But there's no, you know, nothing else [laughter] to keep it going.  But it

1 you.#
1 you seen THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY, PART TWO?
1 B:  Yeah.  The first one was really good.  But the second #one [laughter],#

1 But people who bring kids #irritates the heck out of me. [/talking].#
0 B:  Well, that's lucky.  
0 B:  Yeah that's good.
0 B:  I can see that.  
0 A:  and, uh, and make their kids stay there.  We found on in the area that,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  that's exactly what it was with us.  It was just, it was, uh, we, all we
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  So, it's, it's gotten, it's changed a little bit over the years, but, uh,
0 A:  But, the kids, uh, [breathing] the kids just, well, we used to use them a
0 you know, what's available to play on and, uh, and what's outside,
1 wherever ch-, it happens to be cheapest and they happen to want to survive at
1 [laughter],
1 A:  Hum.  Well, I speaking of kids I've one hollering at me so,
0 two coats, and are they,
1 A:  I don't want it all over the brick and windows and,
0 B:  and we have, we have some more that need to be done, 
1 A:  I wish you good luck.
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, do you think that's, do you think that's right?  Do you think,
0 cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America.
0 A:  mother came over and, uh, he, you know, I just ((get sorry)) feelings for
0 A:  and that their governments can become so corrupt and it's like, well, you
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Well, sometimes that's, that's America doing that too --
1 then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader, you know
1 B:  Well, they actually understood, it is in America where it was hard
0 They, they've, their very vocal.
1 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  I'm doing fine.  Where you from?
1 B:  #Ah.  Ah, my, I got# my mom a #teacup ((little mutt)),#
0 A:  #[Laughter].#
1 Well, after you had an animal for a [laughter] couple of weeks, it's, uh,
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, uh, I, I, I typically am not a cat person.
0 is like no other cat I have ever seen.  And, uh, it would sleep on my chest,
0 don't know, I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog.
0 B:  a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life.
1 A:  -- when she was younger, she used to do that to get even with me,
1 A:  #Uh, and, and,# you know, some people might not believe that but, but, but,
1 protest.
1 B:  And so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket,
1 attention now?#
1 day.
1 you know, and it creeps up on you.  You don't know that, uh, you know
1 all over.
1 plus the burial expenses.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  -- I'm, I'm looking for another cat for them.  Uh,
0 B:  #Well,# 
0 A:  -- I think one of the good ways of solving that is to like, everybody likes
0 B:  -- so that there are a lot of problems along that line also.  And perhaps
0 like a [lipsmack] a mock one.  And, okay, this, this candidate #tells# --
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
0 people vote in primaries for that very reason.  Uh, they can declare anything
0 And it's going to #take these young# --
0 the other #kids# --
0 B:  #Sure.#
0 they'd had a class or something or #just to a short time, you know, to,
0 no way I'm getting in that machine.  Well then I realized it so when we went
0 B:  #Right.#
1 A:  Yeah, ye-, ha-, have a lot of values, I love that.  
1 B:  I'm like, really.
0 A:  You know, they've really become very much involved in, in just that one
1 you need a hobby, so, she chose the cats.
0 B:  And you can tell, it's a family hobby.  [laughter] The-, they're all a
1 A:  They're really nice looking cats.  I have seven cats but they're all
1 Those are my children.
1 A:  {Still whispering}  Ugh, house payment [laughter].
1 ge-, you know, to go out.  I just have two that drive me crazy,
0 start going in the front and stuff, I bring them in.
0 B:  Uh, we just bought, uh, acre, a house with an acre to try to, so she'll
1 A:  except that I consider them my children [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah, you know, if I could have, I would have.
1 A:  I haven't gone that far.  I'm not that bonkers.
1 meanest person [laughter].
0 So, sh-, not only is she the better skier, but she got all the attention,
1 She's only five, but I think she planned it [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, see there, she needed that, 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.  We-, she, she's the middle one?
0 B:  And, uh, seems like we're always working on it, as I'm sure,
0 A:  because they're always ((ruining)) something? 
0 A:  Well,
0 B:  No, appliances, we had a couple plumbing problems, we've, oh, who knows,
1 B:  Oh, yes. 
0 A:  It wasn't such a bad idea? 
0 A:  [Sneezing] So have,  
0 A:  so, it was still a lot cheaper than what we gave because ours is thirty
0 pickup and move somewhere else, somewhere else is easy.
0 uh, they go out and shoot and they're from the mentality that when, uh, uh,
0 like we do here,
1 of people that get shot with guns by equally mentally deranged people,
0 for total gun control because I feel like people need to protect themselves.
0 A:  But, um, I think that, you know, the background check is a great idea.
0 B:  and this is the law that's before the, the legislature right now is, is
0 A:  Enough money, that's right.  
0 A:  I, right, 
0 B:  so this one guy goes home, and he stood and talking to his, his, uh, uh,
0 A:  That's right.  
0 A:  Yeah, because she might be,
0 A:  Oh, my gosh. 
1 things, uh, we don't have a lot of, uh, you know, like J C Penny's in our
0 B:  and, uh, they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace
1 car breaks down [laughter].
0 never been able to save any money, and I think it's just hit both of us, uh,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 for about, I think, three months,
0 B:  #or, uh,# uh, making, uh, some dresses for children, or things like that,
1 B:  Now, I don't know how the dog has fared, eating all that plastic,
0 A:  Uh, [clicking] I've seen GHOSTS, we really enjoyed that.  
1 see it, it, because you won't be able to sleep but,
0 B:  Okay, well, I li-, in Carrollton,
1 B:  I mean, even the do-, it wasn't even worth a dollar [laughter].
1 out awhile, it's kind of like, well, maybe I don't really have to go see it
0 A:  I enjoyed that movie.  I thought that was a good movie.
1 A:  Prepared [laughter]?
1 B:  I was prepared for that j-, I still cried, 
0 cheaper to pay a dollar to see it than to, you know, to pay,
0 B:  it depends on where you rent your videos but, 
0 A:  Right, right, because you can alway-, you'll either get interrupted with a
0 A:  you know, you need to just sit through it, and, and enjoy it.
1 commitment.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  so, oh, I don't know now, if I want to see it.  Now, it's like, now I'll
0 A:  Uh, let's see, there was another movie that I saw a preview to that I
0 B:  #So,#
1 longer have any other cats.
0 A:  Uh, the female's red and the male is black. 
0 B:  Um, the freshwater tank's just, really to me they'll, there's, most of them
0 attractive than, I don't know, those fish are just beautiful.  Just so, like
1 B:  Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't dare have a, a goldfish here because,
0 door,
0 to get into trouble.
0 trash,
1 B:  and how, how tight you have the lid down on it,
1 B:  #I couldn't help myself.# 
0 A:  So, you, she knows she does wrong.  But she, uh, she continues to do it,
1 crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car
0 A:  That makes sense. 
0 my muffler, of course, starting going bad right before I was supposed to go to
0 long.  But then when he's finished he's, he always says, well, now you owe me
0 I mean, of course, I loved it, um, but if, you know, I've got other interests
1 from me but it doesn't matter, I mean, I've, I've had greasy fingernails for
0 B:  And, uh, he's about sixty miles from here.  And so, it, and if I have

0 uh, adjusted, and it turned out that they needed repair and it cost like three
0 year old car and it's not worth that much, uh, old ((just have to do later)) I
0 said, I don't, don't do anything with it because I'm, I'm not worth that much
0 could adjust the clutch any because it was kind of loose and he looked at it
0 B:  there I was stuck on the road, right in the middle of traffic, but I
0 know.
1 A:  And, um, that's a different subject, so, I better stay on cars [laughter].
0 eighty-nine thousand miles.
1 B:  Okay, th-, that explains it, yeah, I've got an American made car
1 own oil and filter but I got tired of that, so, I let somebody else do it
0 them take care of it.
0 B:  Yeah, to a point, it's not my best subject. 
0 think, I wish we would have just, I'm not that up on the policy of ways.  I
0 there, but there's a lot. I mean, they, uh, and you can't, the American
0 bad, but they have a rule in Guatemala that he can't have another term and so
0 but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority, the

0 B:  and nice ranches and things.
0 protected them.  See that broke out a revival in Mexico City.  That C B S news

0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, ever since I was a kid.  
0 cats, you know I always thought cats were loose and,
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 wait a little bit.
1 B:  I have a tr-, treadmill, and a, a exercise bicycle, plus a dog I could go
1 walk.  [laughter] And a whole lot of things like that.
1 A:  you know, I feel guilty all the time, because, oh, I shouldn't be eating
0 B:  You do, and you've been pretty faithful about that?
0 B:  That's really good.
1 to see if they stick with it [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.  Well, uh, it's too bad we can't talk about your other interests
1 [laughter], but we just have to talk about exercise so.
0 know, several miles each night.  And, boy, she really got the weight off.
0 A:  Yeah, it, it helps a lot with the walking, because, otherwise, it's just
0 A:  Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
0 A:  All right, bye-bye.
1 B:  and I said "you can walk off your lunch."
1 A:  [Laughter]  That's the way to do it.  
0 can do the class like anytime you want, you know,
0 B:  Um, um.
0 A:  because then I had to, I had to go every week and log in what I had walked,
1 A:  and, I'll go for like two weeks and go, this is for the birds,
0 B:  and, uh, so, what I do, is I bowl.  I am a fanatic when it comes to
1 place outside the front door,
1 mine either.
1 A:  I've never been, I just, I'm more into, you know, sitting, than I am 
1 A:  Same thing, huh, it repeats, the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen

0 did do it for a long time,
0 A:  to not do it so,
1 B:  in the car.
1 B:  No.  Although you can make a sort of a Chinese pizza.

0 A:  You know, a monkey can do that.
0 =============================================================================
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  I don't think so.
0 A:  Yeah, 
0 A:  But they got so much bad publicity, too.  And I think that hurt a lot of,
0 B:  And just because they had, had a couple of bad seasons.  And you can't
1 A:  -- isn't nobody going to beat us [laughter].

1 B:  No.  They're not.
0 terribly hard,
0 A:  Yep.  It's hard.  It's really hard.  I,

0 there to defend our country and they do it for whatever, you know, they spend

0 A:  So what's the answer [breathing]?
0 B:  paycheck and it's coming out of our taxes, too.  {Pause} [baby].  Why,
0 why is these hospitals making so much money?

0 B:  #So our, our import# tax on them is no big deal.  But their, their tax on

0 A:  Yeah.
0 that.
1 my sister.

1 up and saying, will you make me another one and,
0 know, and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that, so.  
0 A:  Yeah.
0 anything like that so, but, yeah.
1 B:  I just kind of sew for my kids and that's about it, so.
0 B:  And, uh, it didn't seem like it was that congested in that, that part.  You
0 B:  Tha-, that, that's really sad, you know, you got young boys or girls,
0 prisons don't have enough room so they get, they get lighter sentences,
0 he's out.
0 B:  And then go to McDonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing,
1 think a thing about it.
0 same, uh, kind of moral upbringing that we have.
0 B:  You know, whe-, we've advanced beyond that, and I think that their, uh,

1 A:  I'd like to have a sports car too, but it's not practical for me,
0 B:  anyway but,  
1 B:  maybe someday [laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  I hope it's not my (( )), [noise], you there?
0 A:  If it's a limited edition usually, no matter what it is, if it's a
0 retail them around like thir-, you know, thirteen standard, you know, and you
0 B:  they, they may have gone down a little bit but I, they're still pretty
0 B:  three thousand ((G T)),
0 B:  ((so)), they just market them. 
1 at cars like that because I think, now, there's no way I can do that
0 little, a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much
0 desert has a rare kind of beauty which, uh, a lot of people don't realize, you
0 are, are pretty nice and it's sort of like that, I mean, it's just almost
0 surreal, in some places.
0 B:  Yes, yes, yes. 
1 A:  I just ((like)) I just finished watching that a few minutes ago,
1 A:  also ((saves a lot of time)) with commercials. 
0 professional wrestling, it seems like it's just, just, just like pros in a
0 know I've seen it during the day in Florida.  When I was at my parents down
1 policemen or something else,
0 I think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness
0 B:  Oh, yes, I mean, when I had, uh, I was watching it, the, first time I ever
0 and, and at least they used to when it, when it, the first ones I saw they
0 and they had a, a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the, uh,
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Really? 
1 B:  Yeah, that's, you know, just minor. 
0 A:  Huh?  
1 on them.
0 B:  Um, most of the lawyer programs like, uh, LAW AND ORDER,
0 that, I think they put things on at, um, eleven o'clock here and I think they
0 to, um, what is it after EVENING, um,
0 B:  that's MAJOR DAD at eight I think it is.
0 A:  Yeah, that, that would all start at, at, um, that would all start at, at
0 programs but it goes into night programs.
0 B:  But, uh, do you ever watch CHEERS? 
1 B:  Yes. 
0 and,
0 A:  Uh, things like that but I, I do feel like companies are justified and I do
0 B:  and carry material, and they carry acids and things too.
0 B:  and then it funneled down to, uh, the general population,
1 A:  Well, I've been lucky, I've been called twice [laughter].
1 have, you know, I know, I, I mean, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do
0 B:  I used to smoke years ago but I don't now.
0 even the, even the best of labs, they come back with erroneous samples,
0 B:  Oh, okay. 
0 times, you know, uh, they'll go, oh, yeah, I was on a prescription for this,
0 A:  just to check the validity of the lab, yeah, and, uh,
0 A:  I sell Avon and Stanley products. 
1 recovering, is watching television [laughter] and playing Nintendo with my
1 B:  I enjoy reading novels and then, uh, you know, more serious stuff
0 B:  Today's his birthday.
1 B:  So, but, I guess that's a little off the subject. 
0 A:  Yeah, we mainly just did ((little)) black and white, it's,
0 A:  worked on this for several weeks [laughter].  I just haven't got back to
1 B:  I've, yeah, here and there but they make it lo-, uh, I, I know that,
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 but I just don't think, see myself ((whipping)) out masterpieces in thirty
1 minutes [laughter],
0 with my back.
1 that didn't like to do it. I didn't want anybody in my garden, I was a grump
0 [laughter].
0 B:  Well, you have a nice day.
0 them more than one life sentence in order to insure that they're going to stay
1 life sentence, if you have to do that, you might as well shoot them.
0 B:  As long as you've got, the problem, a big part of the problem anyway, take
0 A:  Right.
0 laws to where they know they're never going to run out of business.
0 A:  Okay, one. 
1 executing him.
1 not, uh, lawyers.  In the fact, and that's, wa-, way they've gotten into
0 A:  Right.  Although, you know, uh, [laughter] that, uh, it's kind of a catch
0 and was killed coming into his store.
0 B:  That's we're if you had judges that had any backbone whatsoever, they'd
1 they would just kill the dogs, you know, so, uh, it's, it's, it's wrong, your
0 just being there, you're just working there.  Um, because you never know if
0 prison, I mean, surely they can put them in solitary or something.  I mean, or
0 loves hard rock,
1 that I ought to replace,
0 A:  gosh, we don't need that. 
1 A:  When you matured [laughter]. 
1 B:  Try and give it to us subliminal way [laughter]. 
1 A:  Oh, now come on, no Texas Rangers? 
1 system,
0 A:  and, uh, the ((radio's)) kind of cruel, I mean, think, the, he, ((this
1 B:  Yeah, but at the same time, I don't know, it's pretty far to throw that
0 B:  or (( )) New Jersey.  Yeah.
0 B:  ((Right)).
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 seats and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs
0 A:  You miss the whole thing.
0 B:  Were any of them twins?
1 B:  You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than ((two of them))
0 A:  No, your, I have a friend now that has seven.  And, um, and they're all

1 always give her a hard time (( )) who's toothbrush did you really use this
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 have a baseball team with twelve kids [laughter].
0 A:  they're not all boys and right now we don't have a girls league because
1 A:  I like gardening, I wish I had a green thumb, though.
1 so I'm encouraged [laughter].
0 A:  Um.
1 this stuff in.
1 A:  I'll, uh, buy some plastic and make a little house and,
0 A:  Three.
0 A:  Um, yeah, an, and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go
1 into your property.
1 A:  Yeah, right here, Bambi [laughter].
1 that's not really a hobby, it's a necessity.
0 A:  Yeah, the ((Himie)) is probably the sweetest one.  She's, she's just a
1 little sweetheart.
0 B:  I see.
1 breed them with, can't just go out there and say, okay, you guys breed, you
1 know [laughter].
1 A:  Well, I don't know how you feel about this but, uh, it's really scary to
0 God, look what he did, you know, an.
0 daddy, didn't he.  
1 A:  No, you, an adult can't grasp something like that, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and it's supposed to be like, it's starting there, supposed to be like a
0 is it that you want.  Do you want me to pay you for your eggs or what.  You
0 know, it was that kind of attitude, 
0 mind I just don't, you know, I guess it takes self-restraint when you have a

1 B:  Sometimes they just send them to you and say here, have a credit card
1 A:  Of course, they could always stick something in the credit bureau
1 another one [laughter].
0 B:  And there's another local one I can't, I can't remember what, there's some
0 B:  #logo.# 
0 A:  Just barely I guess. 
0 A:  And I said, what are you talking about.  I've already paid you, and by that
1 nasty letter threatening legal action.
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#  
1 B:  Right. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, a lot of people do that for a living, I #guess,#
0 currency markets were doing, I would go up and start buying.  I'd, I'd start
0 A:  and their expertise or whatever. 
0 A:  vehemently but, uh, it has quieted down, but I don't think they probably
0 pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it
0 be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't,
0 their family mens-, frie-, family members and friends certain medicines were,
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, I think so [laughter].
0 for change that's going on over there.  When that first started going on there
0 some give-and-take in both, you know, on both sides of the, of the picture
0 B:  Right.  And, you know, I think that's, uh, just a, a kind of an indication,
0 A:  And, uh, we do different things now, we used to play ball a lot but now
0 A:  Uh, communications.        
0 B:  Well, sounds like your [laughter] getting a lot of experience in

0 books and we went skating a lot and, you know, she was just always there for

1 certain I had a hot line to his school.
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  he thought surely that I, or I would have bought a hot line,
0 the very very beginning and I think my feeling was that the very best teachers
0 parent is doing something.  Uh, we were fortunate in view of the fact that my
0 B:  So, wh-, I feel that I learned a great deal from my students, uh, with
1 time with seniors,
0 college and he held three jobs.  ((Wally)) was in college and we didn't even
1 B:  He didn't even tell us. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  I usually just, I'm trying to think of, I guess I would tend
0 B:  um, and I don't think I probably ever would, um, although I would like to

0 B:  Um, especially not in the back window,
0 B:  Sure you're welcome.
0 the rock stations.  I also like the, uh, the, the classic rock stations,
1 A:  sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating
1 A:  and it gets kind of old, and they play the same songs over and over,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  [Throat_clearing].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  but I, you know, now that there's just a million rap groups and,
0 big difference in my life not to have a radio that was (( )) easy access, and
0 to albums and --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  That is awful [laughter].
1 while.
0 as handy.
1 A:  but, uh, I'm not planning on doing that for a while.  I just got mine

0 instrument and he played in the band when he was in college and in high 
1 B:  -- and concert band type activities, and he thinks that would be good for

0 B:  Like last Saturday we went, had some errands to run and so we took the kids
1 you know,
0 there.  So we just said, hey, let's stop and --
0 A:  Well, that's right.  But I do think, um, you know, like the current trends
0 A:  Well, what's your thoughts on it?  
0 the market.
1 A:  Yeah.  Well, so are they, are they handling it right?  Gee, who knows
0 A:  Yeah, I, that, that's the part of it I couldn't understand.  I mean --
0 real estate loans are bad.  You know, the greatest majority of them are people
1 A:  You would think I was asking for an appointment with the president.
1 A:  And then I handle the mail order and whatever else.  We do, we do cat
0 B:  Uh.
1 fifty bucks [laughter].
0 recording limit, but now they just say, uh, we're sorry, our recording
0 B:  Well, um, I just bought a home so I've just now went out and purchased my
0 A:  #and,# uh, it also eliminated mowing the, uh, that area of the lawn. 
0 trees right there, is to, uh, you know, just do something like what you said,
0 B:  -- for privacy fence.  So I did buy, a, a weed eater, too, and, uh, so I
0 there in the front yard and, and really do, uh, you know, a lot of
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  #and# replanted with new things,
0 B:  Oh, okay, talk to you.

0 B:  Oh, well that will be nice though.
0 Pittsburg, and one lives near D. C.  So, uh ...
0 B:  #Yeah#
0 industry in our community. 
1 A:  Gee, my, my son works for, no, not for that, okay.  Excuse me, go ahead
0 A:  Um. 
1 B:  if it's something that I don't throw away all the time. 
0 A:  # Right, yeah.  #
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
1 B:  Yeah, we, I was looking through our photo album not long ago and they had,
0 again,
0 B:  Well,
0 B:  Uh, that's the first I've ever heard of it.  I haven't heard of it,
0 A:  Well, I think it was, uh, thought up when there was so much controversy
0 A:  And some people would get military service and some people would get
0 civilian, uh,
0 A:  their room and board and then you have to pay them some kind of a
0 stipend,
0 national parks and work in, uh, neighborhoods to do, um, clean up and that
0 if it's a government run or if it's a private --
0 A:  Yeah, out here in California,
0 A:  a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble, but
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information
1 @@A:  Yeah, [laughter]  I, I guess I've just about run out of,
1 B:  Maybe it's really, maybe I should take life more seriously and [laughter], 
0 B:  So let's see.  What else have I seen?
0 B:  I've, I've been out for years [laughter],  uh,
0 collect the best entries and they make it into a full-length movie.  And each,
0 B:  No.  Um, my husband has a grandmother in a nursing home. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  Well, my grand father, you know, eventually, completely, lost --
0 divide brother and centers quicker than anything,
0 having fewer and fewer friends. 
0 his grandmother that's in it now, she had a stroke and they didn't catch it
0 for three days.
0 they just sort of, I mean, I, it's sometimes hard to even get places in there. 
0 A:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  Yeah, (( )) because the, I mean the poor man too,
0 B:  # Oh.  #
0 B:  # Well.  #
0 father's parents both of them sort of, you know, they just died of something,
0 A:  # Yes.  #
1 A:  All right, do you do garden work?
1 B:  [Laughter]  As little as possible. 
0 B:  So, like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden. 
1 A:  Yeah, well I guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest
0 B:  [Laughter]  But we have like a lot, like my mom likes flowers, so we have a
0 lot of flowers too. 
1 got a patio, and I tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of
1 pots [laughter].
1 his [laughter].
0 they came out with.
0 B:  Oh, my gosh. 
1 I had a whole bunch of different kinds of things,
1 to take the grass? [laughter].
1 A:  Can we leave the grass? [Laughter]  I said, Yes, we may leave that. 
1 we're not taking that.
1 think we will leave that. 
0 know, it would cover it right up. 
1 A:  -- there was nothing.  These people, we have one ugly pine tree. 
1 around it, and it was so ugly.
1 A:  But, one good thing about it, see I don't have to mow the grass or (( ))
1 [laughter], 
0 run it up a fence --
0 gives people a, kind of a, makes them insensitive to it, and {pause},
0 that'd explain a lot of it, and then, uh, I guess the drug thing is really
0 areas, college wasn't even a consideration for the majority of them.  They
1 nurse in an emergency room, and boy when they come home from work together,
0 or three car incident and he starts his paperwork when he gets there and then
0 they have those twenty and thirty car pileups on the highway.  It'd take a
0 B:  Uh, over the whole process.  I, this'll be an ongoing, uh, process, uh,
0 from now on.  But in, uh, a year's time you might be called up, I don't know,
0 know, to eliminate those problems, but anytime it's a purely random sample, uh,
0 B:  And, uh, so they send you to that, and then they monitor you, I believe, on
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 understand all you have to do is say no? You know --
0 A:  #And I me-,#
1 A:  I don't, I don't know what it is [laughter]. 
0 elementary school teachers do you think are going to be on drugs?
1 B:  Right.  Uh,
1 B:  I guess the only, the only concern I'd have,
0 child would be in their class. 
1 one of those in any, any given year.  So.
0 but, I mean, he's done that for five years.  Why get rid of him now?
0 like that.  I mean, if I, if I were in Detroit, I would start building the team
0 A:  -- you know, which they did. 
0 come back. 
0 A:  No, but Butler didn't hurt either.  Uh, and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt and,
0 B:  Are you an Orioles fan?
0 here once in a while.
1 A:  Yeah, I'll be, I'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  And this lady, you would think it was her own. 
0 B:  Really?
1 B:  Oh, yeah. 
0 A:  Y-, well, yeah.  I guess.  I'm going to quit as soon as school, the school
1 B:  Uh, good [Laughter], 
0 roughly two years, and she, um, she had to go back to work, they had some other
0 A:  And they didn't just play all day long.  You know, like, I noticed a lot of
0 Jell-O?  Speaker A answered: Yes.} and interviewed on, or interviewed at, um,
1 outside with them and, it's hard to drag her away [Laughter]. 
0 A:  # that # place. 
1 A:  Exactly.  Exact-, I wanted,
1 B:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a nephew.  He's a little brat. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  [Barking]. 
1 B:  I know. 
1 A:  You know, when their parents come,
0 B:  # and # all,
0 A:  set back in the woods?
0 brand new when I checked it out and, of course, it was beautiful and,
1 A:  # clean # and smelled wonderful in there, but,
1 A:  you know, I, that, I didn't base everything on that. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  But, um,
1 B:  # Right.  #
0 B:  Right. 
0 guess ten year olds.  Isn't that,
1 have kids of your own,
1 B:  # you'll # understand [laughter]. 
1 A:  But anyway.  Well, are you ever, are you, b-, are you, are you married
1 A:  I didn't know we had one either [laughter]. 
0 American policy where, you know, they're just trying to, you know, military
0 A:  how long it's going to last. 
0 A:  I don't think, [noise] uh, I don't think, the, the, uh, problem about drugs
0 B:  Every time you drink Scotch, you're paying Kennedys. 
0 probably four or five movies a week. 
1 A:  We've got a good video place out here and, uh, uh, oh gosh, uh, I'm just
0 B:  Uh, no, not ye-, [laughter]  I know that sounds funny coming from a woman,
1 so many people said oh, no it wasn't, you know.  But I guess,
1 A:  Oh, [laughter] well I hope I don't run across them. 
1 B:  So it'd probably be a good thing for me to see.

1 the sofa to get you, or something, you know,
1 B:  Oh, that was one of my favorites, yes.

0 B:  Yeah, Paul Hogan. 
1 reverse. 
0 B:  Yes, yes. 
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 A:  And, or, not, not a friend, a cousin, a cousin. 
0 A:  Oh great, what kind of lawn do you have?
1 Dallas.
1 mowing the lawn.
0 A:  I just love it.  In fact, I, uh, mow my lawn, but there's a gigantic vacant
0 field in back of us, uh, that belongs to Richland College,
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 dark and I'm going to have to guess where, where the line is to mow. 
1 hour, for an hour and ten minutes or so. 
0 lines, I guess there was fields here many, many years ago, cotton fields or
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, I got, I got so carried away with water and fertilizer last
1 days.
0 B:  Yeah, that's right, we never did this watering stuff, everybody waters. 
0 entire June, July and August without any. 
1 A:  # But # they still think I'm a Yankee [laughter]. 
1 stand wore pinstripes suits and played baseball.
1 as we left, uh, they only lived downstairs. 
1 was immaculate.  He did a great job on the yard so, yo-,
1 A:  # so, # I guess you can't have everything. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 everything in my closet, I had made.  But I haven't sewed since then and that's
0 A:  on like that. 
1 A:  And, uh, it would have helped me out tremendously [laughter]. 
0 A:  uh, it really makes it look professional and I've taken some classes
1 at them and I think, God, you know, I, I should be able to do things like this
0 B:  and  I asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny
0 squares.  So she did, and I crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby,
0 B:  One of these days I keep thinking I'm going to finish it because it would
1 you.
1 B:  Fast [laughter]. 
0 A:  and  we, we would, uh, trim the seams and finish the edges. 
1 A:  Right. 
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Otherwise, they hold it over your head forever, right [laughter]. 
0 course, my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it and I'd love
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  So, I try to save that for the weekend.  I need to get better at it though
0 I wanted some extra money,
0 A:  And, uh, it,
0 it's the loopers that form the, the edge, you know that edge finish. 
0 it to do things like button holes,
0 A:  Uh-huh. 
0 B:  [Breathing]  An, and quite honestly I, I feel very strongly that the, man
0 B:  # But, yeah.  #
0 B:  As soon as, as the trial was over, then it was stoning. 
0 woman in lust.  Because in the Old Testament, they could look all they wanted,
0 that's what, what I mean by their character changes and, you know, what I mean,
0 B:  But. 
0 the law's not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness.  We were, we went
0 A:  # [Throat_clearing].  #
0 A:  Right.  Yeah, I know, you're right, they would lobby that and, and I see
0 catching it on the radio dr-, on the drive in to work.
1 ther-, there is a lot of people in our country that would go right off the roof
1 B:  concealed or unconcealed.  I'm all for that. 
1 but I, I've not ever felt comfortable in it.  I guess it's [laughter], I'm
0 of those things.  [noise] Um, I was reared in Texas so.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Yeah. 
0 that to somebody.  They've got to {pause}, on their own, have made that
1 A:  Wow, I dropped the phone [laughter].  
0 get up there and do it was major effort, you know.
0 people,
0 now,
1 B:  Yeah.
0 um, the mother really, would given approval, but because of the situation, we
1 control, so, that's, that's a good idea, there too, I like that but,
0 A:  you know, I mean, you're like going, I mean y-,
0 B:  but that's exactly the, you know, the way it was.  And of course,

1 the worst of both worlds, communism and capitalism. 
0 lots of money,
0 B:  #Right.#
1 help them [laughter]. 
0 B:  and I think that we've got the, the people power to do it, it's just, uh,
0 B:  And there's a lot of housing, 
1 agree with you.
0 between, you know, the intake that you get from T V and, and movies, and what
1 I was smart, ran away and got married,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Um, the thing that Carter works on, uh, Habitats For Humanity, I was
0 else would donate their, their time, and, uh, the materials were at cost.  And
0 A:  So there's no incentive for them to do anything.  {pause} Far better for
0 them to sit on their butts and draw the money.
0 A:  Yeah.  What do they, what do they do in Maryland, do they use highway
0 years old --
0 A:  -- somewhere along that range, but that's just an extreme example. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  I would imagine, you know, the situations are out there. 
0 things, like we should know --

0 people with money back then and, uh, affluents in England, uh, that, you know,
0 B:  #And# I couldn't believe, I, I could not believe that it took me so long
0 classics than I did,
0 A:  Well, I like the classics too.  Uh, I think that there's a lot of books out
0 type books.  Usually, I, I'm going to the book store for a particular reason,
0 uh.
0 A:  Yes, and, and, uh, I buy some of the, not self-improvement books, but, uh,
0 purely just for enjoyment, I, I had a major in English and linguistics, and so
1 which I have to work on, basically,
0 of those, it's like I said, it's like school, you have to work at it.

0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 light reading, you are still getting some, uh, mental exercise [laughter].

1 A:  That sounds more like our winter weather down here. 
1 A:  Oh, I mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street. 
1 B:  Thanks a lot [laughter]. 
1 A:  Uh, in between the thunder showers, yes. 
0 B:  Oh, yes, well that's about the way our weather is here also. 
1 A:  You, are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open?
0 up here it may ru-, run into a cold front coming down from Canada. 
0 A:  But, uh, uh, thank God for small favors, the, uh, uh, what do they call
0 them? The, the, the marching band or something?
0 B:  Well, of course this is tornado season, uh, in to, uh, we have many
0 tornadoes spawned in this area.  And northern Indiana, now we're in the

0 I don't think there's a lot of politicians want a heavy vote out because, uh,
0 I, I really think it's obvious.  The answers to me is just to have longer, you
0 A:  But, uh, uh, that pushes some people. 
0 me, [cough],  I can understand, you know, why a lot of people don't vote on

0 you're not, if you're not interested in the game, you wouldn't, you don't care
0 B:  You would have thought we would have had close to half of the people in the

0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, if you can get by that hurdle.

0 like to use some of the places like, um, Kinder Care or La Petite Academy.  She
0 A:  # Yeah.  #

0 A:  So why hav-,
1 B:  Uh, okay.  Let-, go back to that one to ten scale where one,

0 B:  This, this is where the question of gun control comes in.  
0 killing people instantly and, uh,
0 B:  and, and, uh, serve but they don't get a salary.  And they give up, uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 coping with that was they were going into the military and they were getting
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 we're going to have, uh, ov-, I guess we've got some of the best roads in the

0 B:  Why don't you start first, and I'll think about it. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.

0 B:  (( )) two cats and ((just as easy)) it just never started smelling, I would
0 put just a little bit of cat litter in there,
0 all the animals but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely

1 A:  and, uh, you know, used to drop mice in (( )) this is not, these aren't

0 know, and, I mean, everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card.  We
1 are going to charge you interest, ((and stuff)), of course, she ter-, tore it up.
0 you know, they may not even discuss it, they go out and cash their check thinking
1 that, you know, they've got something, maybe they've won something.
1 you use it maybe once a year.
0 A:  and she is charging out of her mind already.  And I'm going, you just got off.
1 That's how you got on to it to start with, you know, what is the matter with this
0 generation and that, we think we need all these things and I think my
0 kitchen setup and you don't, you know, do without too much and, you
0 put it on a charge card, put it on account,
1 charge a whole bunch and lose everything, did you?
0 A:  Yeah.  But wh-, what, uh, what did you, uh, are you with T I or how did you
0 B:  # I hear you.  #

0 B:  Am I still employed by T I, no, I took a leave of, of T I back in November.
0 B:  No.  I should have taken the, the, the, you know, uh, option when that was

0 B:  Oh, that's a beautiful place. 
0 once you pick that spot out, pick out what you want to do. 
0 A:  # and # where I want to go. 
0 would have)) looked at the whole thing here, I'll take a chance, if I don't
0 like it, I'll go someplace else, do something different.
0 A:  # and # the situations change, uh,
0 dinner out, uh, that, that, halted a lot of it as well as just the, the, uh,
1 uh,
0 immediate area that's totally really expensive.  You have to go a ways to get
1 me.  You know,
0 will cook the steak just right.  I have to remember how to ask for it for this
0 that right?
1 went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual, um, sometimes
0 A:  # Right.  #
0 look for more, um, uh, quiet ty-, more of a subdued atmosphere now and I think
0 is carried throughout it's chain, but in this particular town, um, I live about
0 fifty thousand students. 
0 thinking in a sense of, uh, just being exposed to more.  It just seems like in a
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 B:  And I was looking at an annual last night, something had sp-, it sparked a
0 so it's still pretty fresh on my memory,
0 she wants anyway but that was the big deal and,
0 A:  can you imagine, that's a, that's a Pillsbury plant I can't imagine plants,
0 B:  Right, yeah. 
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah, and the gr-,
0 B:  Good grief, these are well fed cows, uh, [laughter], 
1 A:  and I'm just like, oh, my gosh, and the smell is really bad they sa-,
0 going to be a problem for, um, just the, the Earth, you know, what the Earth
0 A:  okay, we're really going to get involved it, it's really becoming a
1 kind of interesting, though. 
0 everybody. 
0 A:  Where I work, there, they have, uh, uh, recycled paper thing so you just,
0 B:  You know.  How many people are using, how many people do you know that use

1 is Dominique.  We call him Neek.
1 a wimp and,
1 B:  or what you act like,
0 A:  Uh, [breathing] I, [lipsmack] I just knew today, uh, you know, that we
1 were going to find him, you know, and when we didn't it was, like, oh, no,
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.  
0 A:  You know.  I really do, because he knows exactly where he lives, so
0 neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property.
1 and, but if he's not in the mood, you'd better stay away from him.
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, oh.  
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 B:  Well, you know, that, animals are like that.  They like to roam and
1 A:  Yeah, I guess that's probably true.  I don't think it's anything we did
1 a good home.  I think that's what really bothers me the most about it
1 B:  [Laughter] yeah, that sounds like kids.  
1 B:  [Laughter] Oh. 
1 the Ranger baseball player that used to be here.
1 Ranger games, and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  and if they don't have their booster, [breathing] any kind of saliva or
1 B:  Well no, but we spent twenty years in Oklahoma.  We're a mobile society
1 [laughter]. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  And we did a lot of research. 
1 B:  My spinach [laughter]. 
0 B:  No, no, you don't want to be on ladders, do you? [talking]  You don't want
1 A:  Worry about all that kind of stuff [laughter]. 
0 B:  -- and buying all these cotton clothes, and then, of course, you have to
1 and,
1 husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear [laughter]. 
1 rid of them, but [breathing] no, I folded it up neatly and put it away
1 time,
1 A:  You know, I have very little furniture,
1 A:  # but # my ironing board is part of my decor so,
1 it in there and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore [laughter].
1 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 what I do and they just go, oh, how do you do that?
0 B:  So, uh, but, yeah, I, uh, I know several of my girlfriends, though, we, uh,
1 know. 
1 A:  My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes. 
0 A:  Well, that's actually a good question.  My wife works out of the home, our
0 recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum.  You can actually buy a whole
1 stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten. 
1 B:  You can only tell that to somebody who understands binary. 
0 B:  So what, do you, uh, uh, work with a computers a at T I?
0 @@A:  Yeah, they certainly are.  So let's see, see so I guess with respect to
0 B:  I think we did. 
0 A:  -- it's not a day or night that goes by in this, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 know, you just, you just never know.  You know, it's.
0 A:  I sometimes get concerned about, you know, driving down the, down the
0 A:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  Yeah.  That, uh, I guess, uh, the, uh, the number of, of beds available in
0 A:  Yeah.  I agree.
0 B:  #Well, I've,# I've got two that are, they're still at home but they, they
0 B:  And even at that, it's, you know, it was a real touchy #situation as to
0 A:  That's right.
0 know --
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah, well, that's cool.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 it, because some of it is just really awful,
0 A:  So, 
0 A:  Thank you. 
1 know anything [laughter].
0 I know, that like if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income
0 bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your, you know,
0 A:  but we could find one.   
0 A:  No. 
1 B:  Yeah, I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
0 But, {pause}, I'm wondering if there's another issue here, and maybe this is
0 it's, it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults, can they go
0 little bit extreme at this time, but say, I think Bangladesh would have been a
1 A:  That's the last thing you want,  
0 A:  Right.    
0 it was a radio or television in the background. 
1 A:  # and # I've had two cornea transplants.  Shopping is no fun anymore
0 B:  Well, we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some
0 A:  Oh, I see. 
0 husband goes to pick it up last week and we couldn't go get it sooner because I
0 B:  And if we do that, I just tell the credit card company, don't pay the
0 charge,
0 B:  But I was wondering like, you know in our case where we knew we were buying
0 B:  # on # I B M P C and I was wondering if you,
0 B:  Highlands [laughter],  (( )) chain down there that I don't know up here. 
0 A:  Don't they? Well, this is, is was a regular, uh, electronics store, you
0 A:  # Yeah.  #

1 A:  -- and I've been talking about it ever [laughter] ever since,
0 house, I, I don't guess it'll hold more than twenty people --
0 and it's, uh, just kind of like a hole in the wall, but the food excellent --
0 A:  I find that most, most family owned restaurant or, or single restaurant,
0 A:  # Exactly.  #
1 B:  # and # you can't eat that [laughter]. 
0 B:  And I guess it depends, you know, if it's just you and your husband going
0 B:  But, uh, and also we, we, uh, I, I wasn't too much on Chinese food until I
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

0 A:  Um.

0 A:  Although I would like to experiment with, uh, the meals my mother made, you
0 B:  What kind of meals did she make that you liked?
1 A:  But anyway, I'm, I'm thinking of the easy way, rather than,
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  Oh it would,

0 B:  That's true. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 said, Oh, I'm looking forward to a nice turkey.  I said, Turkey?

0 A:  She said, What?
0 A:  Oh, yeah, I saw them.

0 they have more on their limit --
0 B:  One thing I don't understand is the, the whole concept of death row. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.

0 A:  It doesn't do anyone any good. 
0 A:  Yes, people need to be punished,

1 A:  And I'll read your book sometime. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  That's good. 
0 B:  Okay. 
0 B:  -- and, uh, I might say it was a little humid running out there tonight.  I
1 A:  We've had all the rain that they should've had out in California. 
0 B:  [Laughter]  Well, what, what, what we like to do is get enough rain so not
0 having to pay money to water.  And, uh, of course, of course summers, summers,
1 I, could, I could do without the three hundred dollar electric bills
0 A:  And of course, it's a new development and there's only one house in the
0 living now, uh, that my neighbor had it.  And I was forever trying to get, you
0 up in March, they greened up, and everybody's grass is, is, is perfectly

0 under ground. 
0 B:  Uh, if you remember, uh, uh, downtown Dallas, you could go down and look up

0 and I didn't realize it when we came over here, is the covered parking.  It is
1 and be able to get into your car and touch the,

1 when I think of crime and, and things that could happen, I, I guess that was

0 A:  Uh, up in, uh,  Wisconsin.
1 B:  Yeah, that's pretty minor, when I think that some people give their lives
0 A:  Sure, uh-huh.
0 B:  So, I don't know the answers though.  I, I, I do wish we had a system that
0 A:  -- the suburbs.  It's not near as bad in the suburbs as it is in the city.

0 but it, you like to have it there.
0 comfortably as I did before I was laid off. 
0 A:  Right.  You're absolutely right.  That's a good one.

0 but, uh, I'm looking at, uh, doing a lot more of it because, you
0 B:   You know, it gets it down to about forty.  
1 got a, uh, mountain bike, 
0 B:   And, I don't do that.  I basically, I, I pretty much lay off

0 A:  Yeah, yeah, in fact, go he-, right ahead, sister, if th-, if you're going
0 B:  Right and I might think if you're going to lower the standards, you know,
0 A:  Yeah, and I don't think they're motivated by greed as much as men are.
0 (( )), but. 
1 A:  Well we really didn't have a whole lot to chose from down here, but
0 B:  # [Laughter].  #
1 B:  I guess New York is still, still behind the times, not like,

0 B:  Oh, every now and then,
0 apartments and then the, the houses are all, most of the houses are pretty
1 A:  Nice and quiet, so.  I don't think I could live here much longer but
1 B:  # I guess # we chewed up the house market,
0 B:  and apartment market for a while. 
0 real responsibility of it.
1 A:  I think part of it is that that we were abroad for a good part of the
0 time [laughter].
0 B:  Oh gosh.
0 B:  moved here, uh, and then had my parents shortly after they moved here.
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah, uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah. Oh no, that for sure.
0 B:  Yes I do.  I work full time and my husband actually is going for his 
0 in that he could do a lot of his work at home --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 [noise] but yes I think so,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Well I hope so, I mean I look at these toys on T V and I just,
0 A:  I think, you know, from what I see, a lot of people just, it's a token,
1 A:  Oh my, my, my son would love to find a woman like that I think [laughter]. 
0 B:  Cartoons?
1 B:  [Laughter]  Oh gosh.  I don't know whether I'd go that far [laughter]. 
0 B:  Well, see the thing is when, when, I, I am from, originally from Ohio,

0 B:  # Oh.  #
0 with the world and,
1 B:  Well, in this day and age that's wonderful to be able to do that
1 [laughter],
1 A:  # And # I'm always amazed that you can catch a large trout on a hook that
1 small [laughter]. 
0 B:  # for # some reason, so. 
0 B:  When I grew up, when I was growing up, my dad was an avid fisher, fisherman
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 B:  Well thank you. 
1 A:  And, uh, yeah I was amazed.  
0 until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole

1 she said there's a lot of longevity in that name, said my cow lived seventeen
1 years [laughter].
1 climbed up and then,
1 screaming and made me pull her back out.
1 B:  And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off
0 A:  Oh, okay, my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to
0 would go in the lake, it wasn't like he didn't --
1 A:  No, no.
1 A:  Yeah, well, it's been nice talking to you, we seem to be degenerating here,
1 so [laughter].
1 B:  Sure.  I used to cycle around the block two or three [laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter]  Oh no. 
0 B:  Yeah, they, they go around and they give you these boxes and you, you fill
1 the, the landfills,
1 B:  # inner # areas of them are, are protected. 
1 you know. 
0 they don't decompose as rapidly as people say they do so they just buy the
1 ones that don't decompose at all [laughter].
1 A:  I thought that was interesting [laughter]. 
1 A:  Like, like compost [laughter]. 
1 little blue things flickering through it but,
1 A:  Oh no! You messed with Texas [laughter]. 
1 contributed to that [laughter]. 
1 been able to, to confess that to anyone and now I've gotten to confess it. 
0 there's so little left on this earth where there is that sort of thing and of
0 B:  -- and it's inevitably doomed and spa-, you know, all they got to do is
0 A:  I'll think of you [laughter]. 
1 B:  Please do. 
1 B:  However, no, I'm sorry, maybe up to a nine or a ten.  
0 A:  So, I think that ought to be, uh, tightened up.  I favor, uh, uh, holding,
0 A:  And a lot of people own guns just as a hobby.  And, uh, hunters in
1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Yeah, that's certainly true.  I mean I own a handgun myself.  I've actually
0 to use it and so on, but I never did.
0 at them.
1 anyone else's [laughter] who was,
0 takes a great deal of, uh, abuse before we get our act together.
0 B:  She didn't want to, wasn't going to serve that person anything.
0 A:  With guns I think it ought to be the same way.  
0 and goes and shoots somebody I would really have the feeling that they're
1 the owner of the gun who happened to be a police officer [laughter].
1 brother's got a gun at home.
1 A:  What are you going to do about that.  You got two hundred million guns here
1 line of defense [laughter].
1 and, and attack other countries, but at, at home here,
1 terms of the, the economies of, of things, uh,
0 twenty-five years ago Japan wasn't, uh, [noise] hello?
0 last,
0 the sixties and seventies. 
0 B:  I don't see any real way out of it, either on my end. 
0 occasionally, that seems to have been broken apart pretty, pretty well,
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
0 A:  And that's probably got something to do with what you're saying about the
1 A:  It's, it's, it's easier to, to fight, I guess, when you can find them
1 [laughter]. 
0 the rest of the military units and just says, hey, look, handle it,
0 state of the country,
0 uh,
1 still could buy General Motors products and it was probably not that bad.
1 B:  And, and, of course you don't buy General Motors products over there
0 A:  The others were hand me downs through the families.  
0 them up,
0 B:  And we'll probably be there with all of them.  You know, it's the same
0 at T I, I'm a quality manager and we're, we're uh, we deal, we sell, I'm in

0 the past few years [breathing].  You know for quite some time, just about
0 B:  Well, uh, if you,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yep. 
0 B:  That's it. 
0 the jury that, that, put, that handed down the death sentence because it was
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well, I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that.  Uh, I,
0 they wanted. 
1 B:  Uh-huh {pause}. Yeah, exactly.  Well, anyhow I guess we both agree that,
0 just quit, oh, about fourteen months and two weeks ago. 
0 restaurant, seated at table with, uh, non smokers I would try to pick a s-, a,
0 B:  And, uh, but, uh, now I'm on, the shoe's on the other foot [breathing].
0 A:  because there are precedents saying, you know, well, it's, 
0 A:  You're probably right, uh, and a lot of cases, too, it is uh, in a fit of
0 A:  you know, should get the book thrown at them.  I,  
1 A:  you know.  I'd rather go out with a camera now, 
1 A:  Okay, so I guess we kind of, we've solved that problem, right? [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] I don't know if we solved it but,
1 crazy about guns myself, but being from hunting families I tolerate them
0 [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.   Well, that's,
0 ==========================================================================

0 base five, which is very interesting.
1 B:  Wow, so this is the perfect topic for you. 
0 how would you, you know, power wise, was that less, well actually less
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  So, it, everything is relative [laughter]. 
0 isn't correct.
1 with you on that. 
0 A:  -- yeah, and I gue-, I, I should imagine that, that, that what the, what

0 B:  That's right, and, and I have, I have no problem, with, uh, a certain, uh,
0 these things, I guess that's trickled down to the states and,

0 A:  It's, it's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents

0 B:  Oh. 
1 B:  No, no, no, no, oh, I could never do that I don't think, [laughter].
0 A:  with those things but, man, they are, it, ut-, I don't know to me that
1 you.
1 A:  A little negative reinforcement there while you're going.

0 A:  Yeah.

1 A:  His lips are moving. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah, my favorite,
0 B:  Right. 
0 A:  Right. 
0 B:  Right. 
0 that is to keep the, our government, uh, rotating, you know, keep them moving,
0 uh,
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
0 A:  # and # not get the career politicians (( )).
0 ============================================================================
0 A:  Yeah.

0 far as the yard work or housework or,
0 B:  It's, if I'm really interested in what I'm reading, I mean, hours can go by
0 B:  Yeah, right.  See that's the other problem I have.  If I start into
0 know, that type of thing.
0 B:  It's terrible, I, I really like books that, that you can get into and
1 B:  Do it.  I can't, I'm not that focused on something.

1 A:  Sometimes. 
0 telling me about it. 
0 A:  Yes.  
0 B:  Your kidding.  
0 B:  Well, [breathing], ((I don't)), I don't really think that they sh-, they

0 B:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Works Progress Administration,
1 A:  though I can't see why it was great.  
1 A:  Uh, they wish only for the paycheck.  
0 B:  [Laughter] Well, they wish for the money and they, they decide that
0 A:  Yeah, be it selling drugs or whatever.
0 B:  # Rather than using taxes.  #
1 A:  Not Reaganomics, thank you. 
0 B:  Oh, you think, you think that would, uh, have a major effect? ((Well, that
1 something new that they could tax. 
0 A:  It's just sensible on their parts,
0 A:  # a # lot of ((Millspec)) and NASA work operates to the same demanding
0 what kind of taxes they pay in other countries. 
0 A:  Oh, yes, that, that's the, uh, the type of thing that really irritates me,
0 A:  it's way out of hand.  I'm almost turning into an isolationist [laughter].
0 B:  Wouldn't our money be better spent helping here at, at home?
0 back a lot to the same thing that you said initially, you've been overseas and
0 A:  # Federal.  #
0 B:  # to # get things enacted.  That's not going to slow them down at all. 
0 B:  Well, the question is wh-, who's ready to put their hand on the first

1 cat just really doesn't care about the dog at all.
1 A:  Doesn't, doesn't get too excited about anything?
1 A:  is he?
1 A:  In front of the screen and, uh, they, they just seem to know, I guess.
1 A:  Neither did I.   
1 A:  Oh, gee, that is a big rabbit.   
0 spoke very softly and had a television playing in the background throughout.
0 A:  and so all the things come out of the, the property taxes,
0 works out real nice.  Um, the, the flip side to this is, are we getting what
0 A:  And, then, at the end of, uh, school year they would be tested and then
0 to be taught, you know, like, uh, uh, each child is individual, 
0 that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed.  Some ki-,
0 B:  Um.
0 school four and half days a week, so.
1 A:  And, uh, God, if your child is not an honor student, well then,
1 A:  And it was just a complete culture shock,
0 A:  because I mean, they, they're riding on the bus in the morning with, uh,
1 B:  Yeah that would be quite a shock.
1 about going to work [laughter].
0 A:  But, uh, up here they seem to have made it, uh, a lot of fun for them and
0 ===========================================================================
0 B:  I mean we've had alo-, all ours for quite a while and,
1 A:  Of course, they're probably all Japanese, too.  I'm s-, [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, I'm trying to be more conscientious of,
0 A:  I know it and, you know, I, you think you ought to take it back to the
0 A:  And (( )) I bummed a ride to work all week long, 
0 B:  Uh, yeah.
0 B:  Oh I, yeah.
0 A:  I think is sixteen hundred dollars.  I said my gosh.
1 the bank, you'd get new carpet in a couple of years [laughter].
0 A:  he just was really, uh, coming on strong and he jus-, almost threatening
0 A:  and so I cancelled out of it [laughter] [breathing].
1 [laughter].  
0 A:  Well that's good.  
0 A:  I don-, I feel dumb talking to a machine for some reason.
0 answering machine, then you have to call everybody back.  If you don't have
0 A:  That's right, [laughter] then you know that yo-,
0 B:  Right.
0 A:  As soon as something new comes out, well prob-, I, 
0 B:  Um, life insurance, long-term disability, uh, vacation. 
0 A:  Yeah.  What is their sick leave policy?
0 A:  # they # get penalized for it. 
0 B:  # or two? #
0 sick for more than a day and then, you know, if your children get sick,
0 A:  # Uh-huh.  #
0 B:  You know, staying home with the kids but that's still, you know, kids are
0 B:  I got that when I started because I was, because I'm an officer of the
1 A:  # I # just go in debt for vacation [laughter], 
0 A:  Yeah.  I have to pay for my husband which is kind of expensive for him, I
0 B:  Well, that's good.  How,
0 B:  Yeah.  But more and more companies are going to that now. 
1 I would have qualified.
0 A:  But, uh, as far as personal life goes, I guess, I really try to use them as
1 little as possible, uh,
0 A:  Well, that's kind of the way we ((were doing)) it's, uh,
1 people think they need to get paid.
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  you ei-, you either pay the thing off or they come get it.  
1 A:  And it's turned into personnel and they come get you [throat_clearing].
1 A:  so, you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that,
1 A:  and most of the time it is.  
1 A:  {Very faint} Yeah.
0 technical expertise.
0 uh, they're still a little bit over all simpler, you know, to work on, but,
0 Advanced Auto closed fifteen minutes ago, and --
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 B:  Wow [breathing]. 
0 B:  I mean, was it,
1 [\noise]  thousand, and mine's an eighty-eight and it's, it just turned over
0 A:  I, I will, I don't, I don't think I'd ever buy another Volvo.  I bought it
0 A:  # [Throat_clearing].  #
0 says, Well, if you'll look and see what's happening, [lipsmack] foreign cars
0 major problems that they'll have to pay for on top of that. 
0 A:  public,
0 the future.  But,
0 A:  Well, that's great.  
0 A:  you know,
0 A:  I know, it really is.  And we just need not to buy the stuff and those
0 factory pollution in Dallas you can see it some days,
0 A:  Yeah, it's awful.  It's nothing like California where the smog is constant,
0 A:  Well, I think, I don't, see I only teach English, 
0 tre-, trees can grow back --
0 know, plastic is recyclable, but not that many people use them,
0 A:  Yeah, that's true.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 don't, and, uh, and I, you rationalize and say, Well, I only am four miles
1 [lipsmack] you could easily say, Well, we should go back to living in caves
1 [laughter],
0 A:  And that, and that it's right, no way, it's,
0 A:  you know, so and you have to experience some things.  You know a lot of
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 more, 
0 don't go,#
0 A:  Wow.
0 B:  In, in other words like anyone can live,
0 B:  and I mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to
0 A:  I, I can't, [laughter]  I don't know.  Uh, sometimes I think he is and
0 B:  No.  You mean like, no, I mean, the thing about Rose, I mean you know that
1 B:  # He's, # he's, huh, he thinks he's an adult now but,
0 over in East Texas and w-, my son and I borrowed a, one of these pop up trailer
0 B:  # Uh-huh.  #
1 was a raccoon that came into our campsite and stole some of the food, you know,
0 was a little, uh, I got it so it wouldn't, wouldn't shed,
1 sleeping and he would just dance around the floor and I just got,
0 A:  but I cannot believe the whole family just, 
1 B:  Okay.
1 A:  #Clyde the iguana.#  
0 just, he went and found this guy in, in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one
1 B:  Oh no, oh no.
0 brought this Norwegian elkhound an, 
1 house and, and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air [laughter].
0 it was, that was funny too, watching him kind of burned up but anyway.  
0 clean animal, uh, we, h-, he went to the bathroom in the bathroom.
1 be sure you left the doors open, you know, he didn't like to go anywhere else,
0 A:  In the winter time there was no smell at all, no odor at all to it.  And
1  A:  Well, what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you
1 seal point, she's the little girl and then, uh, n-, Newhart is the, uh, the,
1 wants his belly scratched and that's it, you know.
1 B:  # that's good.  #
0 I'll get a, something like a Filet Mignon, little eight ounce Filet Mignons
0 A:  Then some kind of dessert, whatever, and, uh, usually wine or beer or
1 whatever. 
1 A:  Uh, she, she likes it so-so. 
0 A:  # raw # egg white on it and hold, uh, you know, hold it s-, you know, in
0 A:  You can even just dip a little flap of it in there.  It doesn't really
0 A:  I love,
0 B:  Rotel tomatoes?
0 A:  what brand they are.  They're, uh,
1 B:  I know I love deer steaks. 
1 B:  In Kentucky we use them maybe once or twice a month.  Now if that
0 B:  Well, that's good.  ((I except that, or my, that and my)), well, Lord, my
1 our union seceded.
0 think in, in the long term we could see a, a situation where there are, in h-,
1 recently in the hospital and so for a moment Dan Quayle might have been,
1 B:  It's a joke [laughter]. 
0 when they have the next presidential elections,
0 the Soviet government starts retreating, you know, because of these civil wars
0 B:  And so I think just from that there's going to be some limited amounts of
0 disarmament.  They'll still be republics with the missiles, the ones that are
0 A:  Yeah, you shouldn't be doing.
0 you know, where they're taking the money from especially, th-, the Dallas
0 really, [sigh], you know, so I don't, I don't say that in a selfish way
0 was ridiculous.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  And I found the cheapest thing I could find that I could help her with

0 A:  All right.  Say just, per se, my husband's friend knew that a pee test was
1 B:  Oh, gosh.  That is really scary. 
0 B:  It's really scary to think that, uh, some of these guys,
0 B:  #Huh.#
1 B:  #So you're# starting from the b-, [laughter] from the baseline.
0 B:  -- this sort of stuff.  Because I was gone only an hour at a stretch or an

1 B:  Yeah, I like cabins.  They're real nice [laughter]. 
0 a little bit off the beaten path, but there's a cluster of them and we wound
0 my idea of going out, you know, and being with nature so,
0 A:  # and # I, I'd like to try that sometime with him where they, they actually
0 just take the sleeping bags and whatever food they, they hike in someplace, you
1 B:  my body can't handle,
0 B:  I want a queen size air bed, you know, to go in the tent or something. 
0 B:  Yeah, I can relate to that [laughter]. 
1 B:  # I mean, I can't # imagine, you know, the diapers after three days, forget

0 B:  # week # for what it would cost you to buy all that [laughter]. 
0 A:  But, uh, but I used to be a real good camper when I was younger.  I, I mean
1 mean it's just kind of like, no, no, not me. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Let me tell you, when you get older, you get smarter. 
1 B:  [Laughter]  I guess. 
1 A:  # a # little drastic with kids, but for, you know, two adults,
0 B:  Unless you just go and wear them out so badly that they'd collapse by the
1 time they got off the raft they'd be [breathing], 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah, that would be fun. 
0 A:  And, uh, it, you know, that, they end up staying home, you know, another

1 A:  He sure did. That I agree with you on.  Yeah.
1 but [laughter],
1 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, well they all start with J [laughter] so.
0 B:  Yep.
1 B:  and fact, uh, the best tight end in football is now their coach

1 B:  My goodness, uh.
1 B:  Well, we didn't have any, uh, avid, uh, activities like that, 
1 depth, #I guess.  But, we would,#
1 A:  so we did, you know, we did try, and of course we learned too.
1 B:  but it's not quite so much the hand-holding and peanut butter and jelly
0 making [laughter].
0 A:  Because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned
0 B:  That's right.
0 B:  and then you took it off and put it on the tree, so at the end you had a

0 and they're [breathing], I'm talking two and three hundred thousand dollar
0 you know, whether it's, you know, rich people like that are going to buy, you

0 you stay in an apartment?  If you're not going to touch your yard, you're not

0 A:  Yeah, the same thing.  Is there any, uh, what did you think about the
0 A:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  Well now, they have had so much good response from this,
0 B:  and we just don't have it available out there where we are.  But when we

0 B:  [Lipsmack] uh, they're, and my husband, they're all scouters and, you
0 scouts.  Does, does, scouting have a gun section where they, they teach them
0 A:  They just plink.
0 B:  # Um.  #
0 B:  # That, #
1 I, I sure would work on it [laughter], 
0 B:  Uh, and we couldn't get enough people together, uh, to go, so it ended up
0 B:  # involves, close to the ocean, #
0 A:  Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of, of a rather
0 B:  Our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that, too,

0 to so, you know.
0 B:  # Yeah.  #
1 B:  As long as I have a shower nearby, I'm fine [laughter].

0 know people who had been neighbors once upon a time,
0 B:  Association, yeah.
0 even,
0 specialty, uh, food shop ordering something to send out of state and the man,
0 A:  Sure.
0 B:  Is it?
0 B:  Yeah.  I didn't use to, but now I really, because I get so angry about what

0 government running things.  
0 B:  So, so have you ever voted at all?
1 B:  How old are you?
1 A:  [Laughter] I'm twenty-six.

1 yeah. 
0 the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway.
1 B:  Right, everybody's got a secret [laughter].  So,

0 or have it at the library or, 
0 A:  if people stopped thinking like that.
0 B:  Well, not in my family [laughter].
1 B:  And that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved [breathing]

0 B:  Yeah [laughter].
1 A:  Well good luck with the, the new kid.
0 B:  I think a long time ago, when we were going to go there they were having
0 A:  Yeah, you don't really have that problem there.  They've got their own
0 A:  You know Cancun is just really overbuilt. 
0 A:  And, uh, over the years as it go so crowded, that, you know, you just can't

0 A:  # Uh-huh, well it, #
0 pretty disgusting.
0 A:  Yeah, I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments, but
0 I don't have an actual instruction book so I'm really in kind of the beginning
0 on the windows and things like that [laughter].
0 A:  Well I was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip
0 A:  Well I wish you very good luck with it and I will tell you that I have
1 and supervise [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, I, I need to go to the dentist, so.
0 that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Or maybe a ben-, uh, not really a benefit, either, but would be
0 benefits, since, like I said, um, I don't have a big problem with, with them. 
1 A:  Great, I'm glad you are, I'm not. 
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 A:  Yeah, I like high school football, which again is not the subject, but
1 athlete,

1 basketball up there.  The Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd
1 [laughter]. 
1 But, I, I, I can't get interested at all, zero. 
0 B:  Because they, they start, they shoot so much, and then the last, what, five
1 B:  Yeah, what should I tell my parents, huh?
0 they tell you what to do and you do it.  It's kind of a, you drop in a couple
0 t-, education.  I could be wrong about that, but my experience with Texas
0 know, just go on and on and on.  I mean, so many people don't even get
0 paper that, that Medicare will be based, payments will be based not, uh, just
0 B:  Um, well, I don't live in a house, I live in a duplex.  Um, it's typical
0 A:  Is it, is it brick or,

0 B:  [Laughter] Well, I haven't gained myself back financially yet,
0 B:  Oh, okay.
1 was just talking to someone seeing whether or not I couldn't hire you back
1 A:  And, uh, I can't, I can't afford to leave, and I can't afford to leave the
1 the, on the subject, [laughter] so if you want me to stay on it I'll try.
0 B:  Um.
0 B:  but it, I'm trying to keep my daughters in the schools they were in.
0 B:  That's,
0 so nice.  Maybe I can do it.  So I called and found out how much it costs to
0 there, which makes it nice, because you get to appre-, you get to share some
0 B:  -- I guess it's what they, their, the Mexican kids get a good education
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 redoing that and going to make it a museum, a national museum.
0 A:  Yeah, and then they'll ship the parents back and that leaves the children
0 B:  You would think they could at least get a, a, a visa or something until
0 A:  -- #the way it was then.#
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  the peninsula, 
0 A:  Yeah, #and that's a terrible paper.#
0 B:  Uh, we can, but I don't like it.
0 we have now, today.
0 A:  If anything, they, I #think they list-,#
1 B:  Well, I cannot stand Dan Rather. 
0 A:  No kidding!  Oh, wow!
0 we're a, a subsidiary of, of a larger company, so we have all the benefits 
0 increase.  And I thought, God I'll be stupid if I don't take this.
0 A:  Huh.  
1 what I did, I never could really tell them what I did because I didn't know,
0 B:  -- you think, oh, that's twenty years away from now, who's going to worry
0 about it.
0 A:  um, that's about the only thing we're doing for retirement now.  When I
0 B:  Yeah, I stayed home with my kid, I guess the longest I ever stayed home 
0 worked nights.  I was home, I was sleepy, but I was home when they got home
0 A:  Three times six is what, eighteen?   Yeah --
0 A:  #Well, it's, it's like this,# we don't see it, so we don't really miss it.
0 B:  That's right, I went the other day and had them start taking some money 
1 A:  All right, so, uh, what about automobiles?
1 B:  So it's actually not a real pickup truck, you know.  
1 now we're a two pickup truck family.
1 conditioning,
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 helping a guy move, you know, 
0 basically.
0 What, yo-, so, but your wife drives a Mercury Topaz, they're nice too.
0 B:  Oh, that's really good.
0 that got [barking] good gas mileage, a little something to get around town.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 sportier looking, you'd be saying things like, it has a good back seat, uh,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  And I said well the reason why we should sell yours, Laura, is ca-, see
0 B:  with seat belts.  I said and we can seat buckle in a car seat there, so
1 know, we haven't crossed that yet, so.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 he said why don't you just look in here.  And we went into the Isuzu dealer,
0 A:  Oh, now, I lo-, I like the turtles.  My little boy's four and he loves
1 B:  Well, we don't have any kids but we like them anyway.
0 B:  Oh.
0 right quick, what's the last movies we saw.  He said well GHOST and TURTLES.
1 A:  It was, oh, it was good movie, though, I can see why it won so many
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Molly Ringwald.
0 A:  He's got curly blonde hair, he just a little freckly, little boy.
0 B:  Yeah she's, this one, you know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and
0 B:  And I think, you know, around here, it's all ready quit playing.  But I
0 here, but it's just been down here a couple weeks, I think.
1 his throat, you dummy [laughter].
1 house down the middle [laughter].
1 A:  No, and he could climb out the window [laughter].
1 door honey, sorry.
1 it's been so long since I've seen it.
0 with the stuff we've heard more about than,
1 B:  Oh, fantastic.
0 he picked up most of his sayings from the other cockatiel I had.  The pocket
0 and canary.  And, uh, we could let it out and fly around the house a little
1 bird into the vet at the same time.
1 right next to him but,
1 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And what you find out is, there's, one evil is the same as the other.  Here
0 A:  Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?
0 it's a lot worse for single people, because they pay the same amount as, as
0 you have like X point five children and earn, you know, you kind of get hit
1 A:  [Clicking] {from phone} Yeah.  I guess that's my call.  I guess I better
0 A:  So,
1 B:  I know it.  Or, uh, who cares about the sex life of a tsetse fly?
1 A:  Well, actually, as a matter of fact, that sort of research,
0 B:  Right.
1 A:  #The manufacturer's# probably not making very much profit on that
0 B:  No.  What is that?
0 A:  Well, I don't remember exactly when that started, but it was back in the
0 early eighties, I think.  Uh, Peter Grace of W J Grace and Company --
0 said that, you know the, the kinds of things the government does even in
0 is stretch out the payments so that they end up paying penalties for things
1 sensible --
0 A:  on the Speaker of the House to renovate an office that had been redone less

0 A:  -- and who is a real fiscal conservative.
0 B:  [Noise].
0 B:  Yeah, yes, I know. 
0 --
1 A:  #And so# now they're going to have to assess us because they, we've --
0 A:  Yeah, for instance, we have the Stamford Shopping Center, which was, uh,
1 cards.  We don't handle them very well [laughter].
1 rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa,
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  -- if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 B:  I don't, I don't think that, well, when we buy on credit we just don't have
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, it sounds good, you know.  Like I said, it sounds
0 that much, I mean a lot of people pay a lot more and --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  So, uh,
1 A:  [Laughter] Not my favorite part [laughter].
0 you, uh, sauteed are just right up our alley.  We eat a lot of that, a lot of
0 A:  #People# always exclaim when you have the red and green peppers, and if I'm
0 making a whole lot, uh, I use a yellow pepper as well.
1 A:  Oh, yeah, that's good.
1 cashews and szechuan peppers and he also, not at the same meal [laughter],

0 buy boneless chicken breasts and #save us# --
0 A:  -- ourselves a lot of time.  And that with, uh, d-, have you ever tried
1 B:  Yeah.  You know it's, uh, about fifteen minutes until noon here, and we're,
1 my appetite going.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 about our conversation while we're eating.
0 A:  Have you had any thoughts on this?
1 hand, I'm an economist [laughter].
0 A:  And, uh, just like, uh, well, the military has a tremendous, uh, you know,
0 A:  That's why as an economist my, my, my ears perked up.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Right.  Uh,
0 of engineers is that the military schools --
0 A:  So, it could be, you know, a wage enough to, for have someone to live on to

0 know.  Twenty-five percent dropout rate throughout the country --
0 B:  # And it's, the # bulk of it's going for the school system. 
0 A:  And then most everybody else is volunteer.

1 more [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 working farm near Dayt-,
1 [laughter].
0 A:  I mean, he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon, um, it's
1 B:  that suddenly wasn't necessary any more [laughter].
0 B:  I do too, I've heard too many people say, I hate it here.
0 A:  And they thought they were getting a great deal, um, because they could get
0 B:  I, I couldn't handle that [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Or then, and then you got to wait until you're, you know, after your kids

1 [laughter].
0 quite a bit, um, yeah.
0 A:  Oh yeah, the, the, they give that as, as an example of something that,

0 weird is how somebody can't be trialed, tried, tri-, uh, excuse me, twice for

0 B:   -- and, and that's hard for me, because to me they're giving up
1 get on that topic, I have to be real careful because --
0 A:   That way, uh, maybe then, then you can find out if you're really
1 B:   Right, yeah.  Because I have a feeling I'm not going to like
1 not going up there [laughter].
0 um, I'm not that ambitious.  I tol-, maybe someday when I feel really

0 swirl in the clouds, and, and, uh, then it just grows from there.
0 B:  -- kind of just real pillowy, I guess.
0 B:  And, uh, the sky, I mean, we were right in the middle of it, when, I mean,
0 two years, it's rained, uh, what, I think it rained nine inches in, in one,
1 the summer.

1 so [laughter],
0 A:  One of those things I have to learn about.  I do, I work with kids a lot.
0 hard time holding their attention?
0 I am learning from him how to do these sort of things just, just by watching
0 B:  Did you say, uh, your karate class is all boys or mixed?
0 A:  It, it, it, it is mixed.  There are, uh, there are, uh, more boys than

0 B:  So,
0 A:  and it is open.  
0 or it is too hot up there.

0 A:  Yeah. 
1 A:  Uh, I won't be adding any more to the family reunion [laughter].

0 westerns all th-, all that time, and, and, uh, he was real gung ho.  And then,
0 B:  Right.  Well, uh, you know, Hinckley  --  
0 B:  Right.  
0 surprising, but it was good, you know, [laughter] from my point of view, it

0 simple and durable and --
0 how much they'll want to charge me to,
1 B:  Okay, normally I watch, uh, T V.
1 MINUTES.  If it's not, if it doesn't look interesting, uh, pass on that
0 a lot of calls from, uh, the MORNING NEWS and the TIMES HERALD where they want
1 A:  Friday because they have a house and garden section in the paper
0 B:  Oh!  Okay, Sunday's usually my big one.
1 A:  Yeah, I get the Sunday paper because of the T V schedule.
0 B:  D-, 
0 of viewpoints.
0 scoops and specific stories that, um, I'll say one network that another one
0 A:  Yeah, well it's like I read a lot at work and I really have to make an
1 newspaper suffers to watching T V, and T V is more entertaining, uh, it, uh,
1 A:  Yeah.  There is a show on,
0 A:  Right.
1 A:  Yeah.  And he sets up traps for them all over the house.
0 A:  And it was shocking at the end too.  So,   
0 B:  Oh, oh, yeah.  
1 A:  Yeah.  Especially JAWS.
1 A:  Yeah.

1 directions?  {Mimicks another voice} "No, I hate reading the directions."
0 B:  Oh, really?  
0 B:  But I have not gotten them in years, uh, th-, they were kind of expensive.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And the sloth, it fascinates me.  That's something moves that slow
0 B:  Yeah.  Uh, I, I glance at all newspapers.  I do like, uh, since the re-,
0 B:  to see if there is any go-,
1 A:  Yeah.  Well, I like Ann Landers [laughter].  
0 B:  It,   
0 A:  But mainly I am a front page person.  I do not go into the details.

0 in here May, this house, May of last year.  So it was really too late to do
0 where I went this year.  Because I waited too late to really plant stuff.  But
0 B:  Uh-huh.  And now that will bloom all Summer long and it will, it, but it
0 B:  Now, it's not, yeah, it is not a perennial, it is an annual.  But it will
1 A:  That is, uh, probably enough to see [laughter].

0 B:  You don't?  
1 B:  My goodness.  
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  And, and in i-, it really shocked me because just about six months ago

0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Who makes that car?  
0 A:  I mean but where are they, where are they, what, what is their location, is
1 B:  -- then I'd buy me a fancy little red ((C R X)) sports car [laughter].
1 A:  Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car
0 A:  #But I,# I don't know the performance of it.  That's a,

1 B:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter]  I really, 
1 A:  You know, for example airline pilots.  I mean I do want my pilot to be
1 today because I thought if I'd be there right now [laughter],
1 A:  Yeah, mine is just female.  I'm too big of a wimp to go to the male and
1 something.

1 the kids watch that and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid I ever saw.
1 B:  and, uh, for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic
1 I did not like it, I changed the channel for them.  You know,
0 B:  Because I just could not tolerate that kind of influence on the kiddos.  I
0 A:  we did not have any of the variety, you know, kids have,
0 A:  And, my parents never let me watch anything like that.  I could watch YOGI

0 uh, it wasn't really gun control but it was, you had to register as a gun

0 renting out, so this is our first, uh, I guess, single family home.  And so,
0 A:  Uh-huh.

0 then?
1 B:  Yeah, well, actually it's a lot bigger than we thought it was [laughter],

1 of limitations on lawyers [laughter].
1 A:  No, I'm not a lawyer [laughter].
1 B:  And that just, that really does ruffle my feathers, 
0 had a little static in there once.
1 cooking whatever they have to cook every day.
0 guys that got together and did all this.
1 do these really elaborate gourmet meals.
1 A:  Yeah.  So, I mean we originally started out, you know, when we were younger
0 A:  but lately it's just been once every six months [laughter]. 
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 next day.
0 say when your children start taking up your time, then you, you don't have as
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 A:  Well, yeah, [laughter] that's true.  And we have a gourmet friend that

1 A:  Martha Stewart, you know.  
1 tablecloths and,
1 just gain weight going by the door,
0 Dallas, this is the southwest, this is,

1 A:  I'm from Chicago.   
1 A:  I got to Texas by way, 
1 A:  of Virginia I'm, 
1 A:  and everything is a long story.  But,
0 A:  Oh, really?  
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  Well, see I consider baking different than cooking though.
1 don't know what this is [laughter] going to taste like [laughter].
1 and take home,
0 B:  Oh [laughter]. 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  once a week.  
1 A:  [Laughter].   
1 they knew,
1 B:  all these things [laughter] my kids are eating [laughter].  
0 is from the deep south and so she would do like the hominy and grits and
0 B:  grocery store.  It's on the bottom shelf, and, and it's, um, uh, like red
0 A:  Oh.  
1 said, [whispering] Mom, they had the most wonderful dinner it was Hamburger
1 Helper [laughter].
1 B:  And it's delicious [laughter]. 
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  
1 know.
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Well, I'm getting hungry now [laughter]. 
1 you could talk about.  I thought food. I could talk about food [laughter].
0 really high.
1 B:  Now, this is not SOUTHERN LIVING.  
1 A:  Yeah [laughter]. 
1 B:  And then I'm like, give me the blue cheese dressing.
1 A:  like Oprah Winfrey says, every once in a while you've just got to have
0 A:  Um, I haven't tried the new ones that Heart Smart or not,
1 noticed Bridgeport, Connecticut's declared bankruptcy.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah.
0 A:  uh, they're going to layoff teachers.  
0 B:  But you'd, what, what it would end up, it would be the same old people
0 A:  Yep.
0 B:  Could you hold one second?  Just a second, Ray.  
1 second one,
1 better than that.
1 A:  Um, no, because I can't get beyond making this first quilt. 
0 B:  All you have to do is figure out how to get ahold of some of these people.
1 you wear on your back, so [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, how clever.  
1 B:  I guess that hasn't hit in Dallas yet.  I haven't seen any of that
0 B:  And, uh, ((I got)), I'll, I'll either be working on this constantly or I'm
0 B:  uh, bows and everything.  It's strictly been painting so far, 
1 another sweatshirt again [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Right.  I, [laughter] the year goes so fast it's, 
0 A:  Really, that's true.  Well,
1 @A: Okay.  I hope you know more about the subject of baseball and where they're
1 B:  Right [laughter].  
1 too physical for my, uh, interest [laughter].
1 ever had a son, he would not play football.  And, uh, I had four daughters
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 heavy object, can do a lot of damage but, uh, I think that they have a, a
0 B:  so.  Um, but I stood the, stood the injury wrestling, but it, as long as
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well, I have, uh, I have a broken arm that I had since I was
1 B:  And, uh, the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything,
0 course, uh, Richardson is in the Dallas area.
0 pretty much whatever I wanted to do,
0 B:  Uh, the only other thing I have noticed though is that, uh, it seems that
0 on, on education and what these children should know before they reach
0 B:  And, uh, because, uh, when he was a baby that we did the swimming too and
0 A:  Yeah.  That, uh, uh, watching a little, little boys play soccer is, is more
1 fun.
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  [Laughter] I can't imagine th-, them having as much fun as the parents,
1 A:  Right, yeah [laughter].
1 A:  The, the disorganized play (( )) really what it was, but,  
0 B:  [Sniffing]. 
0 A:  Georgia.  Okay, well, see I'm, I'm from Chicago, so [laughter], uh, I'm
0 never really, uh, listened to it.  I mean because that's just, it was, it
1 B:  Well, there's some joy in it also.  
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Okay.  
1 B:  That's true.  
0 person as to their honesty.  Uh, the only way that you, you know, the only
0 to get evidence --
0 A:  Correct.  
0 know, you don't have to give self-, incriminating evidence.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 her.
0 A:  Huh.  
0 different people embarrassed enough of the, the middle, uh, bureauc-,
0 A:  -- remember it well was, uh, sort of light by comparison.  
0 it was his, like, his, and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor
1 A:  Of course, you know, they got married and they never saw each other again.
1 get back together and get their stories straight,
0 A:  Okay, we can start.  
1 A:  Okay.  
1 B:  -- good.  Impart me some wisdom, Catherine [laughter].  
0 A:  Uh,  
0 B:  Oh, so she's a little one.  
1 A:  She's says how are you doing grandma today.  
1 B:  Oh [laughter].  
1 B:  And, you know, just so that they get to know their grandparents, but also
0 and everybody tends to be in the same boat.  So we, we trade off a whole lot
0 A:  No.  
0 B:  Yes, yes.  
0 I think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most
0 B:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, now I'm, uh, uh, oh, I, we'd, when we moved to R-,
0 dollar spent, and the public,
0 are proposing doubling the tuition.  Well if you double the tuition, it would
0 generate a considerable amount, but I p-, eventually I think you may tax people
1 out of smoking even. 
1 B:  [Noise] I, I don't, I don't know about that, I, [laughter]  I,
0 B:  Whereas in, in, uh, in Dallas here we've, we've got, uh, those patterns
1 cars or something.
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Oh.  See that's also on my list.  
0 B:  -- that's kind of a twist on the normal thing.  And it made me think a lot
1 B:  -- you know, so encouraging,
0 you know, the girlfriends just taking off for a day [laughter] or something.
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, well, I'll have to put that, I'll have to keep that on
0 B:  Yeah.  I also saw that Madonna movie.  
0 B:  It's [lipsmack] TRUTH OR DARE and that was pretty scandalous. 
1 A:  You just had to find it.  You had to wade through it and find it
1 A:  All I know about that woman is that she's an in-, incredible ((marketeer))
1 A:  Well, okay, see, we're getting back to last year.  That's probably the last
0 A:  Huh.  
1 A:  Maybe i-, well, maybe that was, um, 
1 B:  We were not responsible,  
0 A:  Because you sound like you see a lot.  
1 to kind of get beyond that.
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  So, what's it been doing up there?   
0 A:  All the farmers, you know, th-, well, it's good for hay.  You know all the
1 B:  Oh, my goodness.  Well, we have been drenched.  
0 B:  Yeah.  Right now, by now it's usually, no, you know, it's quit raining, you
1 but, 
1 B:  We got enough.  
0 storms and, and all that, so it's been, it's been, uh, wet.
1 [laughter].
0 B:  Huh.  
0 B:  I guess that means you're going to get a double long summer. 
1 B:  And I was like, oh, I want to go home [laughter]. 
1 B:  shoveling and everything else.  He said it was a pain.  
1 B:  It's like, wow, it actually fell on the right day.  
0 you?
1 and, 
1 think.
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah, weather is not real hard to talk about [laughter]. 
1 B:  It doesn't last real long either.  
1 B:  It's got not enough action,  
0 B:  So we're, we're doing that.  
0 A:  Well, that will be fun.  
0 the only grandchildren at this point so they're getting tons of attention but,
1 that wha-, we have four dogs and we barely have time to play with them
1 [laughter].
0 then,
1 said, no, didn't you?  And this lady looked at us like we were child abusers,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  and [laughter] so we had to explain to her we were talking about our dog
0 A:  Yeah, because it was real funny because in high school all my friends were
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  It was so much fun.  
0 A:  Well, 
1 A:  And, we've already looked in the catalog to, to find a little baby ski
1 jacket [laughter].
0 B:  -- last week and on Thursd-, last Thursday as a matter of fact my, I saw
0 B:  Yeah, and they have campgrounds and,
1 A:  But I just kind of keep talking until we quit [laughter]. 
1 B:  But, um, I, it's, it's, I think I'm going to need a pencil, you know,
0 B:  And a wax leaf ligustrums.  
0 A:  Well, we have, we just moved in and we're, uh, trying to, our yard has been
0 left ((untended)) mostly for about six years so there's a lot of clover
0 when it falls into the grass.  It, it just penetrates right through to the
0 B:  Well, I don't know exactly what it does but it cuts, 
0 B:  the grass a lot finer than, than, uh, the old mowers used to do.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Do you think that that's like, uh, a blade that you can put on any
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 for mostly business things.
0 B:  Uh, it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer.  
0 B:  He's got on I B M.  
0 langu-, you know, already know the, the software.  And, um, I don't know from
0 my own experience, um, WordPerfect is just so much better than, than Wordstar
1 A:  Yeah.  And I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper
0 B:  Yeah, I agree [laughter]. 
0 A:  although I think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so, um,
0 number of years.
1 B:  [Baby_crying] {talks to her baby}.  Go talk to Daddy about it.
1 [baby_crying].
1 B:  Yeah.
1 @@A:  Well, that's a, that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life,
0 @A:  Okay.  Uh, foods like you would (( )) for a dinner party or something like
0 B:  Yeah, I guess so, it may be interesting, because probably here in Texas,
1 B:  Oh, really.
1 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  So, uh,
1 B:  Oh.
1 married to a man and have two children that eat about four things [laughter].
1 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 A:  Right.  [laughter] We don't really have, uh, you know, entertain too much.
0 B:  Well, most of the entertaining we do is church associated.
0 B:  and, my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that.
1 A:  Sometimes you have all desserts, sometimes,
0 A:  Was there enough to go around? [laughter].
1 B:  She's only about, uh, uh, a little less than two years old.
1 B:  No.
0 A:  [Laughter] I've got one that's seven and one that's three, so, we, uh, we
1 started saving, but that's all.
0 B:  -- and in the state, uh, they had the best pre med. uh, curriculum for the,
0 A:  Oh, okay, when you said it was quite a, quite a way away, I did not know it
0 that meant you had to drive like an hour or,
0 A:  Right, right.
0 A:  I see.
0 A:  I see.
0 where I went.
0 B:  -- all competing for the same kids.
0 A:  Uh-huh.

0 A:  Yeah.
1 not gave him half the stuff he's got.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  And then United States is not going to use them.  Yeah, right,
1 B:  I have not done that one, I don't know if I have even heard of that one. 
0 A:  # some # I don't. 
1 B:  -- it just gets pretty expensive. 
0 call in sick one day. 
1 will be videos.
0 B:  Yeah. 
1 since the Indiana Jones movies.  I think he ought to stay [laughter] Indiana
1 greasy, and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed and
0 mischief all time.  [laughter]  And, I enjoy those, and I enjoy some of the
0 trying to portray --
1 honest. Um [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  virtually every time.
0 B:  Yeah, I think that's really a good thing to do.  So, where,
0 B:  that's my, I can't hit a driver very far and, in fact, I don't even like
1 I'm going to like golf (( )) the older I get,
0 A:  -- to go an watch the, the, uh, ladies {sounds like some loss of words
0 either you have not played it, or, or you, you have played it and you sort of
0 A:  [Sigh] Yeah.
0 A:  That's okay, go ahead, #it's no big deal.#
0 B:  #Well, uh,# when I, do you get, get, um, reimbursed for the calls you make

0 doing such a terrific job back there, I mean, you know, you pay for it too,
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  My God, they come down here and those houses, that, that look the colonial
0 conditioning bill, per month, last summer was in excess of five hundred
0 B:  Have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that?
0 B:  Oh, that sounds the ultimate.
0 just a matter of finding,

1 he will subscribe to the magazine of it.
1 that was one of our assignments to read, NEWSWEEK.  And I,

0 B:  and then, through college then, I kind of had too many other things going
1 A:  Yeah, I understand.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 magazines, cause he could get them at the student cheap rate.

1 A:  I just thought I was going to throw up,
1 the worse.
1 B:  Oh, god [laughter].
1 A:  #I know# and we are not at any loss for reading material here,
1 A:  There is like a big pile.  These are the magazines we are going to read,
1 A:  sometime.  
1 A:  No, I, uh, no.
0 B:  [Sigh] Uh.
1 A:  It's a mess.
1 A:  In the midst of the recession we are,

0 the wooded areas.  Uh, the facilities are quite nice and our children liked,
0 I think it's close to the dam up there so it's, it's really quite pretty.  Uh,
1 A:  I, I would, I have never been there and I would love to see what it looks
1 A:  She enjoyed it, huh [laughter].
1 [throat_clearing] excuse me, and, uh, one of her pies was auctioned for fifty
0 know, the leftovers.
0 B:  Uh-huh.

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  tennis lessons.
0 A:  Uh-huh.

1 B:  then dump me there.
0 B:  Uh-huh, sure.
0 B:  [Sniffing]. 
0 B:  and all that too,
0 B:  and so it's kind of funny too.  And then, uh, [breathing] then I like,
0 B:  And H G Wells.
0 A:  And it was ((kind of)) it was interesting, I don't know if it was
1 B:  a number of history books, but I haven't read any yet.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and I just never picked it up [laughter].
0 B:  And then, of course, I've read the, uh, Clancy books.
0 A:  Oh, those are --
1 B:  {Faint}  Wow.
1 A:  I [laughter] I thought it was a little much, but it was kind of fun.
0 B:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
1 A:  it's like you just read those textbooks and that's it.
1 A:  Uh-huh, and then you fall asleep and have to reread it,
0 B:  Yep [laughter].
1 A:  the next night because you forgot what you've read.
1 about a squid.
1 A:  Oh [laughter].
0 A:  I liked JAWS,

1 B:  Well, that one is, uh, it's cute but kind of far out comedy.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 having gone, uh, well, it really wasn't on a theme that I was, uh, uh, that
0 A:  Uh-huh --
0 B:  Yeah.  It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story.
1 guess where it was,
1 A:  Well, I'm not either, as far as Bach and Beethoven and all that [laughter].
0 A:  Well, it's really strange.  I like country music, and my husband likes the

1 B:  And now I really do.  I'm, I'm really, becoming Texanized.
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.  I took that in college one time as an easy course [laughter].
1 going to be somebody someday?
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  And then you ju-, you, you pump up the volume, yeah.
1 B:  From New Jersey.
1 B:  That's like about the farthest call from country music,
1 so he'll turn up the radio real loud and say, "Who's this singing?"
0 B:  So you can do things like that,
1 B:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm, I'm being envious.
1 A:  She had so much energy.  I mean, she danced and danced and danced
0 B:  Yes.
1 B:  sport figures too, so I'm a real flunky [laughter].
1 likes SANTANA and some kind of off the wall ones, so,
1 A:  And the cats are, they might be as old.  I'm not sure  [laughter].
0 B:  and she is going to be thirteen this summer so,
1 B:  Isn't that interesting [Laughter]?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  ((up)) [lipsmack] there, 
0 B:  Yeah, so she, and it, what was funny was that, um, our daughter must have
1 B:  unjudgmental [laughter].
0 B:  I mean, um, that made me think of, uh, when our daughter was looking at
0 B:  But, um, th-, I thought that was most unique.  And it just, you know, kind
0 A:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
1 A:  For more years than I want to think about [laughter].
0 A:  She was in the house [laughter].
1 anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet.

1 B:  [Laughter]  Oh.
1 A:  And, uh, they're not [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, my, how, how long?  [lipsmack] [sigh] Probably seven or eight years.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  but, uh, he did go out sometimes and, uh, they ma-, it makes a much nicer
0 cat if they're outside.
0 B:  Is that right?
0 friendly cat, it was,
1 A:  it was not a good, I don't know, it got, it was just, did get strange
0 B:  Um,
0 A:  I think I read about that in the paper.
0 B:  have all these people being tested, and she said, I think we can get him
0 gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled
0 A:  uh, this is kind of a rejection type of thing,
0 B:  And so that's why I said, their childhood is extremely different from mine.
1 B:  [Noise] [laughter].
0 B:  [Child_talking].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  and, uh, it's,
1 B:  [/Child_yelling].  Yes [laughter].

0 cities, you can smell specific things from, [child_yelling] from,
1 A:  Uh-huh, sure.
0 ramifications.
1 A:  So I think the cockroach will evolve, uh, sa-, safely [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Well,
0 A:  to pollution, so,
0 A:  we just {faint} um.
0 cards, because I didn't like carrying, you know --
0 B:  -- it's one of those I'm glad it was there.  
0 B:  [Lipsmack].
0 B:  Oh, it is {whispering}.  
0 payments.
0 B:  Right.  
0 B:  -- I work for T I but he doesn't --
0 B:  -- or it's like you say, you pay forever.  
0 life --
0 is paid for, I've got some home improvements, but even the payment on that
0 A:  -- that is a good, healthy, safe use --
0 was no biggie --
0 B:  And, uh, but I, I do like having them there.  There is a bit of security in
0 having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis, they are there to
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh {faint}.  
1 A:  a hundred kilometers.
0 B:  Right.
0 in the neck, but it's for the better and we'll sort of deal with it, I think.
1 eleven that,
1 B:  to hold it up.  
1 I don't know that I have that much concrete knowledge in the current
1 A:  Let's see, how many cups equal that?
1 I had more friends than that, but two friends of mine in college,
0 A:  We'd go out and just buy, you know, five pound bags of sixteen different

1 A:  but golly, I had to quit my job and stay home [laughter].
1 A:  Oh, yeah [laughter].
1 A:  And, we said no, we will take her and find her a home.  And we did
1 B:  Well, how do you maintain any decorum around your house?
1 going to have children.  And we are, like well, when we start getting rid of
0 half acre to an acre,

0 what are we going to do?
1 like, well, what am I going to do with all this stuff [laughter].
0 A:  I thought, golly.  
1 if they were,
1 B:  Anything was fine, but, you know, now it has to be a certain kind of, 
1 in March.  It was early March he bought them and they are demolished.
1 B:  The inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out.  
1 be wearing them in ten years [laughter].
0 A:  A small number of assaults, uh, well, if we have one murder a year --
0 more.
1 A:  -- but that's which came first.  
0 A:  -- aspect of, uh -- 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  -- uh, for mental duress or whatever.  
0 A:  But, you know, the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the, uh, in
0 A:  In this country, and for example with alcohol or with drugs is, we don't
0 and, and then later, this was actually funny, my brother and I were picked up
1 part of the athletic department, rather than the music department.
1 A:  Oh [laughter]. 
1 of the bell at the back.
0 A:  But in marching season, he's easy to pick out [laughter].
1 suggesting that they ought to also find out what vehicles the parents drive
1 harp,
0 the composer, but I've, based on just measuring number of inches or in this
0 College --
0 thing I worry about sometimes is if, if you get somebody in there that, that
0 ones that caused it or whatever, but, to me, when you do the crime, then you
0 they, they showed something and they asked, they, there were, uh, like four
0 A:  Okay, we're on.  
0 have any control over that at all.
0 B:  -- to go back and pick up that gun -- 
0 A:  I, what, what, what kind of means would those be?  
0 handling of firearms.
1 B:  Oh, m-, me, too.  
0 B:  I'm a, I'm a substitute teacher.  
0 A:  But, oh, and, and I haven't told you I'm going to be at a different school
1 A:  Well, of course, you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold
0 that, she just didn't like sloppy dressing.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  And they'll just wear your common, ordinary, you know, whatever you might
0 think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 to, uh, pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre.
0 A:  Uh, as far as to really go out for an evening, though, I do like to have a
1 hearty steak.
0 houses, it doesn't seem, and I, I find that amazing being in Texas.
0 marinated or, or just regular --
1 B:  Because it's, uh, it's easier to go with two kids, two young kids, now
0 B:  Uh, the service, if they're, you know courteous or if they just kind of are
0 it makes for a nice, nice place to go.
1 A:  No, I think we covered everything.  
0 B:  Yes, I'm, I'm quite aware.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 others in the wings.  You know, there's another school that she, she would
1 B:  Luckily I still have twelve more years to worry about it.  
0 A:  It's not when you look at the, you know, the school and the fact that she
0 that --
0 B:  Yeah, we went on the Blue Ridge Parkway last year -- 
0 they call them first year, second year, third year and fourth year because Mr.
1 seniors or fourth year students [laughter].
0 B:  Well, I tell you what, I've enjoyed talking.  
0 B:  Agree {faint}.
0 A:  That's, that's just it.  I don't understand.  You're supposed to, you know,
1 B:  -- and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too
1 they'd be sitting [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yes, I know.  
0 A:  Yeah, we have plast-, at this center we have plastic, glass, aluminum and
1 [laughter], 
1 A:  They think I'm nuts [laughter].  
1 it away.
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
1 B:  Uh, so until we get curbside service, we cart it all over --
0 office.  I've got the aluminum cans out, and I've got the newspapers where
1 they throw their, uh,
0 get separate trash cans and tell them to put their trash in this one and the
0 the ink was produced with s-, with, a soy based oils --
1 A:  -- because they said it was less toxic.  And I had never heard of that
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 where part of the diaper can be recycled, or degraded --
0 B:  -- of diapers that are still there.  
0 A:  She uses the cloth diapers at home, but she said when you're traveling it's
1 just [laughter],
1 B:  She has her heart set on U T.  
0 were your selection criteria.  Did you base it on what you wanted to major in
0 or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or, you know,
0 because I had been in a small school, they suggested that I probably, I, when
1 B:  Well, then he should come to U T.  
1 A:  Yes [laughter].  
0 B:  Large classes.  
0 A:  -- even though Baylor, uh, and when you mentioned that, we, we have friends
1 B:  Uh, [lipsmack] what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is
0 B:  Uh, in a pretty liberal family for, for that area at the time. 
0 B:  -- in our family, you know, twenty years ago, not that many of the women
0 B:  -- or, or twenty.  So, but that's, you know, that is rural, it's a rural
0 B:  -- that don't live in the, you know, even in the same state. 
0 B:  Yeah.  People marry later.  
0 be engaged for a long time before they get married --
1 B:  In fact I'm,  
0 B:  No, I can drive it all.  It's just me, 
0 B:  Although it's, it's, it is pretty, I don't know, I don't enjoy it that
0 B:  It's pretty much like get there and,  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  We also have a rabbit.  
1 B:  [Laughter] No.  
1 Hound.
0 A:  So I don't have to worry about going out there and, like for example, I'm
1 have a dog if I had a dog [laughter].
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Now has it been declawed?  
1 A:  Well, we have a humongous, uh,
1 back to you, you know.
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  And they can be very nice, too.  
0 A:  And they do require a lot of training.  
1 A:  -- my wife said uh-huh.  No, no. 
0 B:  Oh, that's good.  When we moved into this house, both dogs and cats had
1 B:  And when they pulled the carpeting up, it was so bad on the back.
0 B:  -- and they had to wear, you know, gas masks and stuff, so we moved
1 Copper while we're gone.
1 A:  I said, you don't buy mother dogs, you buy little puppies [laughter].
0 A:  Although I'll tell you what.  It really would scare me like now in the
0 A:  But our dog does have plenty of company.  Let me, because of the, uh, we
1 A:  And he is constantly chasing the kids and,  
0 B:  -- one of their big things that they hype it within the community is their
0 personally pleased with that.  Uh, I'm not sure that it's that, that there's
0 schools do not have cafeterias and kids have to take their lunch back to their

0 accepted to these magnet schools, but she's interested in the arts and in, in
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 really vicious competitiveness between the children at the different high
0 A:  Now I didn't even realize that at all.  
0 A:  Okay.  
1 from August until December and,
1 A:  You probably know where that is because I know where Pontiac is, so, uh,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  I lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes.  It was real close to
0 you know, on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake and
0 there but I thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those
0 slope --
0 B:  And I remember getting up and somebody telling me, hey, better wait to go
1 laughing, going yeah, right, that's a good practical joke, ha ha.
1 snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets so,
1 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  [Laughter] And if it's cold, we say, okay, out you go.  
0 nature of the team to the, to more of the, uh, the, the pure athlete type at

1 B:  Well, I don't know whether anybody can for a whole,  
0 thirty-five and Coit --

0 clowns --
0 A:  And so, uh, I think that, uh, they will come back, and Johnson, while he's
0 done a great job.
1 B:  Oh, ever-, wherever those little suckers are.

0 on the streams.  They were open up, you know, where the water was flowing.
1 B:  [Lipsmack]  So, it's getting a little difficult to do that but, 
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 it but he hasn't really caught enough fish to appreciate any --
0 A:  Right.  
1 B:  And when we're out chasing the big stripers, we use those perch for bait
0 whatever, we were always involved in the parent club and coached some and went
1 B:  My youngest is two and he wants to do it all, so [laughter]. 
0 work and then the, then the wife goes away to work and --
0 make them feel the most welcome when new students come into school are the
0 involved in things you don't want them involved in and, and most of the time

0 they need discipline.
0 time to, to parent.  It's, it's, I don't, I don't know what the answer is to

1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  What a hoot.  
1 B:  -- I don't care what you serve.
0 A:  Well, for appetizers I'd start with, you know, the typical cheese nachos
0 A:  -- and then a layer of, uh, of sour cream,
0 B:  Okay.
0 B:  What would you use for your main course?
0 A:  Probably go with fajitas, uh --
1 B:  I'm a, I'm a lover of paper plates in the summer time --
1 A:  -- yeah, that's me too.  
0 pretty casual for most of everything.
1 B:  Yeah, we don't, we don-, we eat too much meat at dinner parties anyhow
1 B:  If I have a Mexican dinner at any time, I'll do, 
0 usually a, a special fuse that operates the flashers.  Do you have a separate

0 although I think that has been true, uh, always.  Um, {pause} perhaps there's
0 that have been happening, such as the day-care centers and things, are having
0 do all these programs like Headstart and things like those.  You wouldn't have

1 B:  That's just it and right now [breathing] I do well just to take care of my
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  [Laughter] 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  We can't talk about that can we?  [laughter]  We went to #Gulf# --

0 ==========================================================================
1 just don't like them [laughter].
0 A:  Yes. 
1 don't think that I need them, you know.  I, uh, they are tempting at times,
0 B:  but I, I just, you know, sometimes I just don't like everybody knowing
0 A:  Absolutely.  Well, the other thing, of course, is the fact that they hope,
0 A:  you will not pay your bill at the end of the month,
0 B:  I have two little ones.  Yes. 
1 A:  Oh, boy.  Those are two very active ages [laughter].
1 and he gets it out and I don't even think I know my number [laughter].

0 A:  Well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use
1 A:  they figure that, that's correct [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  The idea is to use their money [laughter].  
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Yes.  Everybody in the country is preapproved, I think. 
0 B:  you know, I'd spent this much money. 
0 they own,
0 like luxury cars, they're called luxury cars even though they're much more
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, and I guess, you know, you always have to think about things
0 A:  Oh, it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,
0 A:  I think so.
0 B:  #Bye-bye.#
0 ((druther)), if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play
1 but that's the way life is, I guess.
0 B:  We do that too, we have a, uh, a treadmill and, uh, a bicycle and that kind
0 A:  Yeah, I love to cook, too, I'm, uh,
1 A:  Well, we're all skinny farts so, I, it,

0 A:  -- have a good weekend. 
0 person, the issues is what, you know, what you believe in, and that person is
0 A:  to get elected, and then once they do get elected, they don't have the
0 power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they
0 A:  Yeah.     
0 A:  Yeah.  I still haven't figured out what the zero through six days which day

1 A:  We live right by the airport. 
0 A:  Oh, okay. 
1 baseball player to earn a million dollars?  That's the only thing I found out
0 B:  Oh, you found that out tonight?
0 California baseball.
0 A:  That was fun.
0 through it.  And, uh, they're going to try to make it a real community center
0 A:  Uh-huh [noise].
1 A:  I wish I could [laughter].
0 in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones,
0 A:  Well, but they can't be though, they don't have as much money.
1 B:  You don't even know who to payoff, huh?  [laughter].
1 A:  No.  I had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything,
1 B:  And you never see it.
0 B:  Or working in the system.

1 he was, boy it sounds like your really up on this.  I said, I see at least two
0 should have gotten all those awards, he thought it was too long but I, 
0 B:  You probably don't want to take them to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  It's,
0 got them yet.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah, sure did.
1 A:  Don't, don't ask me [laughter].

0 A:  Okay, um.
0 B:  Right, right.
0 here, although I understand they do in the Southwest quite a bit.  But, um, up
0 Santa Ana wind down here,
0 B:  Well, then you know about that wind.
1 A:  Oh, yeah a little bit [laughter].
0 B:  So the whole wall just opens up it will be all glass.
0 B:  And, boy, it's really nice, it's about an hour drive to work though.
1 B:  ((That's)) unbelievable.
1 A:  [Static] Yeah, uh.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 rather than everybody riding to work by themselves would help a little bit and
0 A:  So, I ride with two other, uh, girls so that way it will only costs me
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  You can see it here.  I mean you can just see it hanging in the air
0 be worse because it, there's no air to blow it out,
0 B:  and everything, yeah.  So I just hope it's not too late.  I hope we've
1 @@B:  But they really haven't.  So, well, what do we do?  Should we hang up
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#
1 A:  #in Colorado.#  Yeah for two weeks, it was pretty fun

1 money than what I'm making [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah. He was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it [laughter].
0 B:  And I've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs.
1 B:  I mean, my agree is absolutely worthless. 
0 college --
1 A:  Huh-uh.
0 thing is, you know, we have a lot of people, especially in major corporations,
0 my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.  I'm,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens [laughter].
1 you're fixing dinner.
1 A:  That's right, you should be careful [laughter].  That's pretty funny.
1 A:  Yeah, that was a sweet and I was like ugh.
0 A:  So I just thought, in fact I'm just also, I'm hearing a siren outside I
0 A:  one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car and it's going off.
0 A:  So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.
0 B:  Yeah, kind of hard that way.
0 a matter of fact.
0 it seems to be it would be important that nobody could, could, could opt out.
0 B:  Oh, yeah that's interesting.  Uh, like you can go, go in the army for
1 eighteen months or you can be a forest ranger for two years or something.
0 A:  [Laughter] Something like that.  I think they do that, we have a German
0 in Germany.
0 have it as a requirement, uh, one being for the, uh, benefit of the youth or
1 B:  Oh, you're dating yourself, man [laughter]. 
0 A:  Okay, so are you a fisherman?
0 A:  Yeah, well, I'm just about in the same situation,
1 B:  that's, that's past the point now where I can use them as an excuse, but,
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  like a second job.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, I don't either really.  I, I like messing with the lures and,
0 A:  and that seems to be what the bass like and what you can catch with the
1 bought, uh, I bought a boat, but I bought a ski boat.
0 Lake Fork and Cypress Springs and we've been to Lavon and Texoma, just,
0 A:  if you have only a Texas license, you have to stay on the Texas side of

0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Just see what it does [laughter]. 
0 B:  Huh-uh.  But, it's just hung on the hook? 
1 reading about it and, you know, and I thought [laughter],
1 things but I haven't done it in so long that I probably wouldn't remember how
0 slippers or something like that.
1 A:  I probably won't make anything beyond this blanket [laughter].
0 A:  Um, I like to sing.  I've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things
0 B:  So are you on the T V then?
1 A:  And so I do little news reports and things.  It's not as exciting as it

0 A:  Oh.
1 A:  Oh, okay.  I hear them in the background ((there)).

0 society today?
1 uh, what was that movie, uh, Mr. Mom,
0 A:  Yeah.
1 consider a more woman kind of business.  I call it like the three C -s,
1 A:  Right.
0 B:  and [laughter] they're into cosmetics like Mary Kay and they're into,
1 clothing store is much preferred,
1 A:  which can really satisfy you and not a man around or, I don't, I don't
1 know [laughter].
1 so you don't want to think about a car now designed by a woman, huh?
1 A:  Exactly,
1 up with.
1 B:  Bob ((Macky)) and such [laughter].
1 A:  and, uh, Halston, course he died of AIDS so there, that's proof.

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 to call, you know, international.
0 B:  Wow.
0 B:  ((What makes you)),
0 B:  And what do you think you'll do with that?
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  What about when you have breaks like, um, Christmas or between sessions?.
1 know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood but,
0 A:  Well, that's kind of like quilting. 
0 B:  Mile a Minute.  That's the name of it.
1 when a good time for zucchini is.
0 A:  #Well that's about, um,#
0 B:  People say that it is somewhat better. 
0 B:  Right.
0 news, pieces of news, you know, so it's hard, I never did see the full story,
0 A:  Right.
0 B:  and everything else that we'll spend the money that's
0 B:  how about nucle-, nuclear energy.  Well we don't want that either.
1 some, uh, I think it kind of washes down from, uh, from your area Linda
1 B:  Yes, I was just talking to my son today, he's up in Boston,
0 delightful.  I come, uh, I've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas
1 thing anyway [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, a little bit.
0 Monterey, California or,
0 of the seasons but, uh, I'd rather, you know, like southern California, you

1 East situ-, [talking] well,
0 about what my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye.  We messed up the
1 conversation, anyway.
0 B:  Uh.
1 B:  Huh-uh.  Yeah, it hasn't been, I know, I was called up right away
1 A:  It took them awhile to find me.
0 A:  Oh, no, [laughter] I never thought about that. I had some questions for
0 Asked her if she enjoyed her job [laughter].
0 B:  And I just knew I was being photographed, you know [laughter]. I'm glad I
1 A:  Yeah. 
0 for me but I, I can kind of understand from the other point of view.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
1 A:  Right. 
0 government, uh, uh, where the government gives them full rein,
1 A:  Yeah, I'm sure it is. 
1 Although, I do watch some of some of those frivolous things.  Uh,
0 B:  uh, I can't think of the name of the one that has the, uh, military, uh,
1 it's pretty cute.
0 enjoy some of it and especially if I'm, uh, cooking on a Saturday evening or
1 something,
1 B:  and one of those is on, it kind of inspires me.
1 B:  Uh-huh, I'm not that hung up to most things.
0 A:  And you could say, oh, that's a good program for them because it's
0 B:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].
0 A:  When I, when I started thinking about this, that those are some of my
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  and see if he could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of it.
0 A:  -- over again.  Which is also, that's another thing that's [laughter] good
0 about it, when it comes on right in the dinner hour.  I f-, can feel like I
0 worthwhile, while I can make dinner and do things I need to do --
1 A:  It kind of kept you guessing on, on, uh, what was going to happen next.
0 the ED SULLIVAN Show. That was really the big deal in our household, #was the
1 B:  They even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan, and it was very, very funny.
0 really little.  That may be why, bu-, they probably didn't have a T V until I
0 A:  And the shows that I like now, they wouldn't let me watch.  I had to catch
1 B:  Huh.
0 A:  Oh, my goodness.  I didn't know they did it long distance.
0 B:  Yeah, I think that's, that's a real important aspect and that, uh, as the,
0 B:  I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch.
0 B:  Oh of course, of course.  As a matter of fact I read in the sports page
0 B:  He's something else, he really is.
0 A:  They coul-, because I don't know but last year I just figured they was
0 A:  Oh my goodness, we might actually get to go to a World Series, huh.
1 B:  to take care of my cats, you know, my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy.
1 B:  It's like all right, whose corners is this one.
0 into hiding.
0 all kinds of nightmares.
1 B:   tod-, I mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for
0 him [laughter].
0 A:  Ugh!
0 B:  Right.
0 friendly and docile.
0 B:  Um, yeah.
1 pursuit.  It's like this train.
0 A:  [Laughter]  A train of cats running around.
0 A:  I have Xanadu and Precious, and Rascal.
1 B:  And she's so ugly.
0 B:  Right, I'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog
1 A:  It wouldn't have, no that would be a problem [laughter].
1 ripped up and down at the bottom he said, of course I love cats.
1 pregnant and have cats.  I'm like, uh, no, no, no.
0 B:  and deal with them, I'm sorry, we are not getting rid of the cats.
0 secured tents real well even if we had done it in the dark at eleven o'clock
1 at night.
0 come down.  Several of the others had already come down, blown down.  They
1 go camping.
1 of course I slipped and fell in.
1 A:  Yeah, yeah, I, I hope to never venture into something that drastic.  
1 [laughter]  Oh.
0 crowded though.  It's not a lot of fun with a whole bunch of people around.
0 or thirty guys playing volleyball on the beach and this, this cove, this beach
1 him up the, the hill and,
0 A:  It [laughter] was true, it was truly awful.  It was not one that I picked,
0 B:  Yes, right, and, um, uh, it, it really was a fantastic movie.  The acting
0 B:  Yes it did, yes it did.  
0 live in a suburb of Dayton.  
1 A:  Is, is the Kmart there?  [laughter].
0 scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the
0 A:  but, boy there's a lots going on in there [laughter].
0 B:  Again the relationship, uh, between the two, uh, that, uh, never would
0 didn't, he only saw it one time, and he didn't go back for more, but, uh, he,
1 disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this [laughter].
0 them.
1 B:  Okay, well, go ahead, I'll let you start.
0 A:  [Laughter] Uh, I was thinking about whether or not we should have people,
0 uh, be required to do public service for a year or two.
0 draft notice and then they give you a physical and if there's nothing
1 you are.
1 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 farming, or, or something like that, so you're really learning a skill [/TV].
0 retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could
0 A:  Oh with W P A.
1 B:  Yeah, that's true a lot of them are still out there.  
1 A:  Well, it's real pretty, it's like a swamp.
1 B:  Oh okay, real pretty, like a swamp, oh yeah.
1 This is, uh, a T I experiment to see how talk, Texans talk to other people.
0 A:  Huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  No.
0 A:  So does your company have something to do with T I.
0 know, on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week.
1 so probably knock T I profits margin way down.
0 A:  Okay, well thanks a bunch, we'll talk to you later, bye.
0 A:  Well I'm going to try to (( )) clean up the house after my two children for
0 B:  #Oh.#
0 they're in almost every shopping center, and you can just stop by.  Now
0 B:  you know, it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their
0 just that sometimes it's not the right people,
0 A:  Yes.
0 uh, properties people came in with all, with the good cardboard boxes.  Not
1 took several home because I'm moving pretty soon and they're good boxes.
1 B:  I think I'll have to try that.  That's really cute.
0 look fancy.
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah.
1 B:  You saved me some money.
0 B:  I mean, they're real hard to find the places that pay.  And that's really
0 bags.
0 B:  Okay.
1 [/barking].
1 they'd have to do [laughter].
0 A:  You know, and it's, it's crazy.  They're just putting more, giving more
0 B:  No, no, absolutely.  You know, it's like, uh, I, I, I don't really quite
0 and obviously had a, uh, had a big interest in, in letting them, their
0 B:  Pardon my for coughing, I've been coming down with a cold.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Well that turned out to be a good game.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Okay, I wasn't living here then, so, I can't talk much about that
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  And, uh, every, every opportunity there is to make a dollar, he seems to
0 B:  Yeah, but that's, that's true just about, eve-,
0 uh, older, uh, they're going to have to, like the Washington Redskins, uh,
0 B:  Yeah, the man you love to hate.
0 B:  I, I'm wondering where he's going to wind up.
0 A:  Not only that, but, they don't pay the money either.
0 B:  Sometimes I've wondered if it wasn't almost more than we needed to know.
0 handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they'll
1 burned to the ground [laughter].
0 A:  I guess maybe they have so much time to fill.  I've thought often times
0 A:  Well it's sure been nice visiting with you.
0 B:  before we can go anywhere.
0 traveled to ((Balise)) and, [clicking] into Honduras.
0 A:  Okay, uh, could you tell me what you think contributes most to, uh, air
0 A:  generate electricity.  Um, there doesn't seem to be much emission from
1 this black ash on their cars,
0 photograph the emissions at that point, and, uh, you know,
0 A:  Um, we've got reports that, uh, during the night seems like they'd blow off
0 B:  Yeah.  That seems a little ridiculous.
0 directly related to the air pollution, other than acid rain, yeah,
0 remember where.
0 A:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We could also, uh, push for legislation for, uh, rapid
0 B:  Yeah, sure.
0 your car anymore.
0 A:  I mean I guess you could take those off too but,
1 patent it, [laughter] you know.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 base systems.
0 B:  Um, so I think it's extremely helpful and very useful.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  in this case.  After you load it up change it, hope that's right,
0 A:  But with windows you can have the program and say it messed up in line
1 B:  Yeah, right, right.  Yeah, I know, I, uh, I remember my college days
1 B:  Oh, that would be great.
1 A:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  And, that, that's the way it would be. 
0 A:  It's like we want to sell it to break even at least.
0 A:  They had, uh, they're trying to get out small computers, but, the only
1 problem was that when they took that one out, the small computer was the I B M
1 P C [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, and are loud so when he gets loud it's not too, it doesn't bother the
1 Italian and,
1 and my roommate go there every Sunday,
0 them.  They don't really come out like they do in New Orleans, up here, I
1 everything, it had all the vegetables in it, but, it seemed kind of boring
0 A:  But you know, when we're having guests, we just kind of say, oh just do it.
0 A:  and so we would go up to the Sacramento, uh, river sloughs, the delta
0 A:  You know, cooled off, but, uh, when I got married, my husband had always
0 white water rafting and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that.
0 like to do a float trip down, uh, oh, like Big Bend area or something like
0 basically own all the land around this little lake, there, it's divided up
0 A:  So, but I think with him almost potty trained and, you know, she's not
0 B:  You bet, yeah, we'll that, you know and there's a lot of places with, uh,
1 A:  Ugh, I would need that before I could teach them [laughter].
0 companies that don't, you know, that don't have good retirement plans.
0 you know, you can pick the kind of insurance you want, and the kind of dental
0 B:  And, uh, I, I think there, you know, it's a pretty good option to have.  Of
0 A:  Well, [throat_clearing] I think of, uh, you mean as far as retirement?
0 even further.
0 B:  Right, right, I think that was, all those factors played a part in, you
0 A:  Well they were, 
0 B:  Yeah I, 
0 A:  Okay.  I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against
1 B:  [/Static] Oh, really.  You're older than I am [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
1 B:  my husband says I'm getting old [laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah, that's, that's nice to do, that is.  [breathing] I've got a,
1 B:  I was one of the forced ones [laughter].
0 A:  Boston Pops or, 
0 B:  I, I've heard, I've heard that that is a really, 
0 B:  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a real,
1 not real old, my wife she is old too,
0 B:  Yeah, that wa-, that was, that was, I remember that being, uh, here a
1 B:  I think, I think they're a bit over exposed [laughter]. 
1 about,
0 for them but that would cost a fortune,
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah. 
0 B:  Oh, no.
1 B:  -- i-, i-, kept and yo-, it just didn't vegetate your mind like television
0 A:  Yeah, I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera.
1 B:  Uh, I think they should do it.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Oh, really?  
0 A:  It's no big deal.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- so it was really good, you know, they were checking, you know, visually
0 B:  You know, like, it's not like they just, like, well, then the second time
1 A:  I don't think you can hide certain drugs [laughter].  
0 A:  Huh-uh [laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter].  
0 B:  I never thought of it that way, but that's true.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  it's like, huh-uh, huh-uh, no.  They need, they need some help, too
0 off them, you know, some people, I mean, that's, th-, they, they go off them
0 A:  If, th-, people have prescriptions for Valium, but they're not supposed to
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  What about, when, when would people do it, when they finished high school?
0 A:  Yeah, I think the Mormon church has, sends out missionaries that,
0 even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things.

1 A:  I agree [laughter].  
1 well, who's going to get ahold of this and think, um, that's a nice place to
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- you know, my, my office address [breathing].  But they have one
1 A:  Uh-huh.

1 B:  Ooh, that's a big dog.
0 laying there sleeping and somebody could carry this child into the room, and
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
1 A:  -- (( )) and then all of a sudden the dog decided she was okay, but,
1 B:  [Laughter] Um, here's a source.
1 A:  Well, I still don't trust them, I'm sorry [laughter].
0 uh, to really do anything against us.  I don't think they're as
1 B:  Right.
1 B:  Right.
1 B:  Right.
0 A:  Uh-huh.

1 A:  Isn't that, 
0 A:  -- and cars and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture, I

0 B:  Okay, I'm ready.
0 A:  Oh, my, you are busy --
1 the time, depending on my size [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] That's how I am too.

0 I, I, however the question is is that making the difference.  
0 and --
0 that has anything to do with it then, you know, or is it, in our

0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- younger children.  My children, our children are grown --
0 B:  Yeah, yeah,
1 grandchildren [laughter].
0 kind of canceled it anyway for that reason.  Uh, the HOUSEKEEPING
0 B:  Yeah,
0 what I get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier
1 of magazines it seems --
1 A:  -- and have things to do at night, I just, I want fluff
1 A:  -- I don't want a lot of thinking [laughter].
0 when I read TIME magazine, after I've read an article I'm real

0 lawns and gardens?
0 B:  Uh-huh.  I, well, it's, it's, it's very [laughter] str-,
1 was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  But that'll change --
1 A:  We'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already.
0 here and then he calls us,
0 semitropical, you wouldn't have that kind of, that kind of
0 B:  Really, oh do they.
1 and she said, she said, (( )) there's no trees down there.
0 A:  -- so [laughter].
1 B:  -- he's, yeah, he's great, and uh, he's, uh, he's really spoiled, though
0 think he barely makes it.  I think he gets beat up even though he's big,
1 B:  -- comes home with a few scratches now and then,
1 a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let u-, let me [laughter].
1 and I said, You know, this is just a, I, I, I can just hear the dog crying for
1 me now [laughter].
0 he got there a little bit earlier, bought the dog, and she was in the back
0 room, and so that night we had a reception for some of the, uh, potential high
1 A:  -- [Laughter] and, a bit exotic [laughter], 
1 A:  for those who love bugs, but, [laughter],
0 B:  And see I was, I was never exposed to it --
1 B:  -- so,
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 and things like that.  But we didn't even have tents there,
1 B:  Oh, good grief.
1 quite enough nerve to do that.  
1 B:  So it's not for the faint of heart, I don't think.
1 son is not eager to go and,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  yeah.
1 B:  Yes.
0 A:  [Laughter]  What area of the country do you live in?
1 A:  I did, too.
0 places --
0 B:  -- type things.  Uh, I don't like to go to the drive-thrus
1 find a Wendy's, 
0 B:  But well, we don't go out that much, I gue-, well, I guess we
1 out somewhere,
1 systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh,
0 know,
0 the other person --
0 B:  And you're in Minneapolis,
0 A:  -- you get some pollutants such as those, but those are natural --
0 A:  -- they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your
0 car fixed,
0 A:  -- if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't
0 A:  without,
0 something --
0 A:  -- and then, you know, they get sent to a mental institution
0 A:  Yeah, oh, I agree, I agree, because we,
1 could convince somebody, uh, I was crazy [laughter],
1 [laughter],
1 B:  Ye-, well, yes, I, but I was from conservative Wisconsin
1 I first turn the T V on, I, I normally go to those, because I pay
1 for them [laughter] --
0 but we didn't get to watch it tonight. 
1 MINISTER and ARE YOU BEING SERVED?
1 thought, Gee, 
1 B:  I don't believe I'm watching.
1 to, uh, that male syndrome of flicking that channel, so,
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  -- [Laughter] you know, and I'm saying let's move right on
0 A:  -- and, uh, otherwise, of course my husband's into the
1 on Sunday.
1 this is a, you know, this is too much [laughter],
1 absolutely sit glued to it, I, you know, 
0 A:  I keep telling them it's the same mentality [laughter] you
0 except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos --
1 A:  -- that are sometimes so dumb [laughter].
1 several of those situations [laughter].
0 now --
0 B:  Already?
1 A:  That's what I was told, 
1 B:  Don't, don't send for them [laughter].
1 B:  Oh God,
0 know --
1 A:  I know this matches.  I'm not going to have to think about
1 B:  Well, you don't need to --
0 B:  -- and, uh, I'm not going to walk, you know, walk anywhere
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 um, ((Chinese Pavilion)) or something.  
1 husband has just gotten stuck.  
0 lasagna and garlic bread [laughter].
1 A:   Yes, they are.  
1 A:   Exactly [laughter].  Exactly.   
0 B:   It's real entertaining for her.  
1 the restaurant [laughter]. 
1 A:   Oh, yeah [laughter]. 
1 A:  And I spend most of my time carpooling [laughter]. 
1 A:  The story of my life [breathing].
1 A:  because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.
0 A:  Yes.  My son, 
1 enjoy it.  So if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.
0 both sets of grandparents and, and take car trips.
1 A:  My daughter and, and I hate camping so we go shopping.  
0 a lot of times, she and I will travel to writers conferences together.
0 with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too #so.# 
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  So, I think it's more than that actually.
1 something against me would, uh, get shot.  But I'm an old country girl that,
0 York and, uh, other cities that have such a high crime rate in the subways and
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  If he had shot them and, uh, shot them or wounded them or even shot just
1 produced you've got people like Jeff ((Dollmeyer)) that was [laughter],
1 have carried a gun, they could have shot him right then and there before he,
0 that have had two, three crimes against them never released from prison, um,
0 B:   Go right ahead.  
1 that it would cover [laughter]. 
1 A:   Then when we actually got out of school and employed and
1 or two you were broke, so.  
1 groceries.  And, and lots of times I go over that amount but
1 B:   So needless to say my budget is probably, 
1 just simply go to the wife and say, okay [laughter],  
1 A:   This is how much you spent on this.  You'd better not do it
1 A:   And that's usually about schooltime [laughter]. 
0 what's called a non balanced checkbook, but I put all, like, fifty
1 bonds.  And, you know, and then when I feel like it, I deduct that
0 dollars into my savings account but now it shouldn't matter.  I
1 want to pay fifty dollars off of my bills that I have, you know. 
1 B:   Yes.  I, I enjoy that forty-five day float very, very much.  
0 handle and you have to leave a little balance.  We haven't for ages
1 B:   [Laughter]. 
1 B:   I feel a lot older.  
0 B:   Yeah.  And -- 
0 perspective working for a big corporation and a professional
0 B:   I, I think it's, I think what you're saying is true and that
0 most of the, uh, movers and shakers are men.  
0 B:   And then in the bank even [static] most of the, you know there
1 A:   Not at all?
0 A:   They just are willing to take the back seat or, 
1 to someone in Provo, Utah)).  
1 A:   [Laughter]. 
0 I'm planning on being a nurse, so [laughter].  But, I don't know. 
0 recognition for it.  
1 B:   And all the patient sees is this woman, you know, hovering
1 A:  Rock and roll?  [laughter]. 
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].
0 B:  I'm, I'm twenty-one so I'm in the, the new kind of rock and roll stuff.

1 B:  Yeah.  
0 that I never got around to.
0 A:  You do?   
0 A:  Really?  That's great.  
1 guitar, they start naming off notes,
1 A:  Oh, just sing it to me [laughter]. 
0 it,
0 B:  Mak-, makes it easier whenever somebody is trying to teach you a song you
1 that's why,
0 A:  That is great.  But now they're trying to convert me because I just moved
1 B:  I, right now my car is terminally ill --
1 know why I think I want one but I do.
1 buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money

0 A:  If you can find one that's r-, uh, you know, reliable [baby_talking].  If

1 A:   Oh, well, you know all about it then.  
0 A:   Uh-huh.   
1 out.  
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
1 B:   They're, you know, they're wonderful.  They don't complain too
0 they're one short.  
0 is the WASHINGTON POST --
1 @@B:   So, what more do we need to discuss [laughter],
1 come back more tired after my vacation, 
0 A:   then I do, you know, before I take it.  Um, I need to
1 like the Bahamas and Florida.  I enjoy the beach.  
1 antibeach.  
0 B:   -- and, uh, you know when the waves go in the waves go out they
0 really big wave came and totally threw me, and one foot did not
1 come out of the sand, [laughter] and it tore the ligaments in my
0 knee [laughter]. 
0 water, the ocean.  I prefer a swimming pool [laughter]. 
1 B:   And I basically, [breathing] don't want to go to a hot place
0 B:   Oh, I'm, we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year -- 
1 A:   Well, you have, you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to
1 B:   Well, I know but I'm tired of them [laughter]. 
1 A:   Yes.  
0 think if I had, if I had the money, I would probably go to Europe
1 someplace like that is, you know, gee, Holly would starve to death
1 if we, [laughter] you know, we took her --
1 A:   [Laughter] Oh.
1 A:   Right.  
1 Plano and carried my little portable radio with me, 
0 football.

0 A:   Well, he's from here.  
0 playing the Cowboys.  
0 last, I don't know, five [barking] or six years whatever it's been.
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
1 to that.
1 A:   Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the
0 getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred,
1 B:   [Throat_clearing].  
0 A:   So it gives you a-, --
0 A:   Sure, sure.  So, 
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 for two days and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing but,
0 A:   And it's a real big crunch, uh --
0 B:   -- it cost us God knows how much.  You know, at a million
0 A:  Okay.  What kind of pet do you have, Gail?  
1 B:  Uh-huh.   
0 A:  Oh, yes, yes.
0 A:  And, uh, uh, and our male cats, you know, we had, 
0 B:  [Child]. 
1 the dog would sleep on my side,
1 A:  and the cat would sleep [laughter] on my husband's side, you know
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  And when everybody turned we all four of us [laughter] turned in a row
1 B:  -- he hated that.   
1 A:  And, uh, and it was new carpeting and, you know, it jus-, just really,
1 the carpet and my daughter is just nine months old --
1 know I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them
1 dog, get a dog, you know.
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:   Yes, but Stalin was a, was a classical example I guess of that
0 A:   Sure.  
1 right now [laughter]. 
1 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 A:   I just moved here and then South Dakota is very seldom -- 
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:   -- some do and some don't require drug testing.  You know if
0 come up -- 
1 B:   And we're closer to Mexico.  
0 know, we're right on Lake Erie, uh, I'm sure our climates are much
0 B:   And right now I'm watering.  
1 B:   Yes.  
0 rust colored.  
0 stress to the lawn.  It --
0 B:   And it supplies Fort Worth with it's drinking water.     
1 A:   And, and so I mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like
0 A:   -- so all she's paying is interest on hers every month.   
1 B:   [Sniffing] So and that was before we got married, so.
1 down right quick.  
0 B:   [Sniffing] All right.  
1 A:   -- a pair of shoes so I just went out and bought them and
1 B:   {Very faint} Are you a, you're a Mormon then?

1 A:  Yeah, [laughter] and get around town [laughter]. 
0 in the back.
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  We seem to do this every, [breathing] every weekend we've been out looking
0 for [laughter] for, we still haven't bought yet --
1 B:  -- so I guess every, every month we don't buy we save more money than we
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 father-in-law owns a plane and he, um, took us to the buffalo ranch
0 B:   The main thing I think about is that it gets so cold in the
0 A:   Uh-huh.  He's, you know, done, uh, I can't remember now but
0 month now.  
0 B:   Yeah.  
0 A:   But, you know, we have to keep doing this and --
1 B:   I think that would probably, [breathing] uh, be very possible,
0 Washington D C.  
0 A:   Uh, you, you've seen that which was on there and the offices
0 not pay proportionally.  
0 A:   Yeah, they don't, they don't seem to, well, I really think the
0 lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that
0 Bush has in mind in order t-, to boost the economy because people
0 B:   -- I can't say it would help with theirs either [laughter].
1 A:   Yeah, and thank God we don't operate our budget, 
0 B:   ((Amen)).  
0 I just, I just sometimes feel like I'm being used.  But, uh, again
0 A:   Uh-huh.
1 B:   No, no.  She's,
1 B:   [Baby_crying] I don't think I could part with her.

0 watch it or, 
0 A:   Is that been --
0 channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen --
0 B:   The C N N, is that what that is?
0 B:   Yeah.  
1 B:   Yeah [laughter].  That's --
0 B:   I don't get that channel [laughter]. 
1 B:   Yeah.
1 A:   Uh-huh.  My goodness [laughter]. 
1 to you but, uh, actually I never get too much fried chicken.  
0 A:   More fresh vegetables?  
0 B:   -- carrots and things like that.  
0 beans.  And that's the type of something that whatever you mix with
1 B:   Oh, yes.  
0 B:   Yeah.  I think it kind of, uh, it didn't really take over the
0 A:   Uh-huh.

1 B:  little glimpses of it.  
0 them back.  
1 A:  and they had to settle their sins, 
0 A:   Do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America?  
0 A:   And that was, you know, prior to World War Two.  
0 A:   Well, I agree with it wholeheartedly.
1 a Texan I'm talking to?  [laughter]. 
1 B:   Right.

0 A:  we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population -- 
0 B:   Uh-huh.
1 B:   Yeah, [laughter] I guess so [laughter]. 
0 @B:  But not as much as I used to  [sniffing].

1 A:   Yeah.  Plus if something goes wrong, I know who to blame.  
1 B:   [Laughter].  
1 so I can get my hands dirty.  
1 car is just not one of those things I want to spend my time on
1 anymore [laughter]. 
1 B:   Absolutely, absolutely.  So, 
1 B:   Yes, one was bad enough.  But I think I got rid of the wrong

1 A:   [Laughter] Yeah, I was just wondering that [laughter].
0 B:   I'm ready.  Okay.

0 to most of the people.  Most of the people really are, uh, honest and, uh,
0 there, then something is taken away from my civil liberties.

1 B:  [Breathing] I don't know, enter Fort Knox [laughter].
1 A:  I didn't care to watch that DYNASTY [laughter] at all.  
1 B:  I think what it is, is everybody [yawning],

0 B:  Like, programmed into my ra-, my car radio, I have any, everything from
1 A:  Right.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh, like Peter Murphy, or,

1 A:  Uh, and I use it all day at work and I put all my personal stuff on it at
0 A:  But, I'm going to ignore that.  That's a call on my other line, so --
1 B:  Oh, okay.  That, I have that, too.   
0 B:  Oh, you do know Lotus, huh?  Oh, that's great.  That's something we want to

0 @A:   wonderful topics.  Uh, do you have quite a few or,   
1 B:   Because I, I am the type that will always find an emergency
0 B:   But once, once I did, you know, it, it only takes me two or
0 B:   So I've, I just finally figured out that for my way of life,
0 just graduated from college and we felt that there was a lot of
0 more opportunity down here and so it helped us out with the moving
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:   I wou-, well, you know, it, it really helped that I didn't
0 B:   And, uh, when I was, you know, employed, then I didn't have
1 somebody, not so much to baby-sit the kids, but tutor them in
0 the years.  Uh, but, you know, I found, uh, like I said, they, at
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 a single parent for so long that, uh, you know, I wished I had the
0 regret, regret, uh, the children, uh, going through that day care
0 A:   Well, good, good.  Course, what really helps is when you know
1 B:   Yeah [laughter].  That made it real easy [laughter].  
1 going.  I just don't handle any money.  
1 to work yet, so -- 
0 spend on whatever you spend it on and, if, at the end of the month,

0 month or every payday she sits down and fills envelopes.  And I've,
1 B:   -- and, yeah.  
1 A:   And, by the way, my name's Bill.  I'm from North Carolina 
0 A:   Uh, I, [lipsmack] let's see.  What kind of books do you
0 like to read?

0 A:   -- but I did enjoy owning a boat, would recommend it to
0 down there and I'd get the boat out on the, you know, Saturday, and
1 to leave the boat out, because, uh, we'll probably do this again
0 tomorrow [laughter].  It got to where the, tomorrow the boat was
0 here from Colorado Springs for T I.

1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- and, and having children that really are pretty interested in, in music
1 B:  And at that point it was either performing or teaching.  It was, like, oh,
0 found carioca last October, I guess, and I was just thrilled.  I loved it.
1 A:  My goodness.  
1 A:  I, I can't remember.  I've only done this one other time.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  -- time music.  
1 @B:   Well, it's kind of a broad subject, uh, I,  
0 education is concerned.  
1 B:   Oh. 
0 B:   Great, okay.  
0 we're kind of spoiled because I think we get, [throat_clearing] we

0 B:   Yes.  
1 B:   Yes, very much.  Uh, course, I, I still work two part-time

0 A:   And, uh, uh, it's real tough --  
1 A:   That's -- 
0 than it is to get onto his.  
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 A:   Because they're, you know, at the retirement age and -- 
0 B:   Uh,  
0 emergency, you wait three months [noise] -- 
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:   But, uh, you can either go with the H M O, or stay with, with
1 B:  That's a rather, rather broad topic [laughter].  
0 High School --
0 A:  Well, maybe that's the answer to crime is getting [noise] more prosecution.
0 dangerous, but certainly I can't understand not calling the police.
0 aware of what's around them, you know and [breathing], if you see a situation
0 care, because people just have to care about another person.
1 A:   Yes.  
0 A:   Uh-huh, I #didn't.#  
1 B:   -- #I understand that.#  
1 B:   With the Sugarbakers.  
1 B:   Oh!  [Laughter]. 
1 A:   #We do#, it's a good show.  
0 because neither one of us, really we usually either watch C B S on
0 B:   -- all those were on and, and ROCKFORD FILES.  But it's like,
1 A:   Well, my husband really likes those.
1 let's --
1 B:   [Laughter]. 
1 I was just going, now what did I just watch for the last hour
1 B:   Even then, it's like, huh.  
1 understand what it was talking about [laughter].
0 B:   You only have to watch half hour at a time.   
1 A:   My husband's a kid.  We have to watch ERKLE, yeah [laughter]. 
1 B:   #Pablo, Pablo.#  
0 B:   Huh.  
1 have that high voice [laughter]. 
1 A:   Yes, it does [laughter].  
1 but --
0 B:   Uh, television shows?  
0 A:   Oh, really?  
1 that it comes on more than the fact that I have to see it.
0 B:   [Laughter].
0 B:   It's kind of like a s-, a nighttime soap opera type thing.  
1 B:   [Lipsmack] Uh, I don't even know, to tell you the truth
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 A:   Yeah.  
1 A:   Oh, yeah.  
0 B:   It's exciting, we're winning, so that's really exciting.  
1 same time.  
1 full three [noise] minutes or not [laughter].  
0 A:   Yeah, so it kind of makes it easy, you know, to do a little
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- and she's scared that somebody might turn on her sometime, and, I'm
0 A:  -- to see something like that.  
1 B:  Uh, uh, everybody heard about that.  
0 force behind the N R A.
0 B:  Because they have an economic reason over and above whatever --
0 has all the work space he needs.  
1 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:   Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come
1 B:   Well,
1 say that.  
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 B:   Yeah.  
0 A:   [Laughter] I think that once you do that, your children kind
0 B:   I finally got to see it.
0 B:   Yeah.  
1 A:   -- then I was just rolling in the floor, just hilarious.  
0 A:   Oh, really?  I can't believe it was -- 
1 B:   Yeah.  
1 A:   Yeah, isn't that crazy.  
0 B:   Yeah.  It's just,

1 B:   And the little critters that are around.  
1 A:   [Laughter]. 
0 B:   [Laughter]. 
1 a competitiveness against yourself.  
1 B:   -- I got my game together.  I've had a par and a birdie,
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
1 B:   You know, we just think, well, the next time has got to be
0 and partially retired, maybe I'll, uh, be able to play a little
1 years and the economy hasn't been,
0 A:  It's, uh, [throat_clearing] uh, I guess [lipsmack], excuse me, just a
0 A:  Yeah.
0 because these, if something could happen to make these people not want to buy
1 A:  #Well,# mine, I subscribe, and then I'll let them stack up #and# --
1 A:  -- and then I'll drop my subscription for a #year and catch up.#
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Which, you may not want to do the project exactly like they show you how to
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 buy #otherwise.#
0 B:  Yeah, we do that, too [laughter].  
0 A:  -- I found out that we could plant, uh, fall potatoes and I'm going to wait
0 in --

0 A:  Yeah.  On the magazines, again, it sounds like you and I like about the
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
1 B:  -- somewhere else and I can make do with something [laughter] a lot
0 A:  #Right.#  Or some of the styles are kind of weird, too, #so.#  
0 B:  #They# really are.  I, I noticed one today as I was looking through a
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 any of that #[laughter].#
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Yeah, and, course, the proverbial diets and -- 
0 A:  -- #uh, all that, but every book seems to have a diet in it.#  
0 B:  #Uh-huh.#  
1 A:  #Right.#  And you -- 
0 personal conversation, only making references to a particular subject

0 B:  You know, and she just liked his shoes and he'd have these dress sh-, --
0 B:  -- hundred dollar shoes. 
1 B:  Oh, it was just bad.  
1 B:  She must have known he didn't like her or something.  
1 B:  Oh, anyway, I, I, and I would shut, I would bar the closet doors,
1 A:  He's beautiful but it's just one of those concessions,  
1 square and he's just huddled up like, if you'll be nice to me, I won't make

0 A:  Yeah, I mean if you're in the, the three, three percent bracket and they
0 that say, uh, you know, call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review.
1 accurate.
1 state.
0 B:  You know, one thing is the opportunity on our income tax to, uh, allow
1 public service, but it, it's gotten to where it's kind of rather hard to do
1 B:  Yeah, well, obviously if they ever looked at our house or [laughter], 
0 B:  -- you know,  
1 A:  Yeah, I'm sure we both can.  
0 B:  -- and so he, he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit
0 always goes and looks at the school before they sign up.
0 A:  -- and being able to go with them to so-, at least some of
0 A:  -- gave me a chance to explain things to them and to, uh, in
0 different places to look for --
0 B:  -- I don't put that much stock in them, but --
0 A:  Helps to at least set up --
0 A:  -- in going to school is just totally different.
1 not.
1 into that but,
1 school system.
1 A:  I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty
1 B:  No.  Of course I use, 
0 A:  Oh, well, that's an idea, that's a thought, uh-huh.
1 A:  My husband loves them [laughter].
0 A:  And that's when you get into expenses.
1 A:  We, yeah, we have the same thing up here, so we don't deal where they do
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 couldn't take advantage of something --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  All right.  I've never done it before, so I guess that's all I have to do,
1 right [laughter].
1 A:  -- and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right.
0 A:  I wonder how long it's going to be on for.
1 A:  Yeah, okay, well back to crime, I guess we're supposed to talk about that.
0 A:  I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  -- last year on the, you know, on the school grounds after school.  And the
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 morals, you know --
0 B:  Himself and her?
0 oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had
0 B:  -- and he just shot them --
0 A:  I know, and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they,
0 understand basically the, the, the competing factions [laughter]
0 in lot of those countries and --
1 how, 
0 B:  -- and one of them ended up at El Centro in one of the, uh,
1 B:  Oh, well, good.  Well, I'm glad you let her in [laughter].
0 far is it from home, [laughter] I had to put in, and then, of
1 B:  Even when they know how to use the washing machine.
1 A:  -- and for some reason men just can't get around that barrier
0 B:  Uh-huh, well.
1 @B:  Uh, I talk about doing that a lot.
0 B:  -- and following it.
1 A:  -- so budgeting is not our priority since we have one in
1 A:  Their expenses run beyond any budgeting allowances.
0 that's all I take --
0 grocery store to get a, you know, gallon of milk or whatever --
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  And, uh, here in Texas there are, there are state parks where
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 man made lakes --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Oh, wow.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  I'm sure it'll be a lot different when she has a chance to
0 A:  Right.
1 A:  Yeah, yeah,
1 B:  [Laughter]  That's my aspiration as well.
0 B:  -- a hundred miles from here.
0 B:  -- you know, of course there's still a lot of work to be
1 A:  Well, I'm mother of four, so basically I'm just, 
1 A:  Oh yeah, yeah, 
0 Tennis, I play tennis.
0 A:  Yes, we snow ski.  We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly --
0 B:  I've been to Telluride which is on the west side --
0 A:  And, um, so, and we're on the colder side, they're on the
1 B:  Well, that was all [laughter] I could take, 
0 B:  Good.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  I wouldn't, you couldn't pay me to work in one.
1 B:  Right.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I thought it might have been something that the state required, but that
0 B:  No.
1 A:  Yeah, I'll just, 
0 B:  Oh, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Huh.
0 B:  That's good.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 and also on, um, just like, I bet you within five days a truck where the, uh,
0 marijuana for lunch and, uh, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in
0 B:  Oh, my goodness,
0 B:  -- because they don't want to lose that lucrative, uh --
0 B:  -- get rid of him and not have to pay his contract.
0 B:  Oh, that's terrible.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Right [laughter].
0 A:  is that, that they're really not wide enough for your arms to have any
0 A:  -- hang down --
0 B:  Yeah.
1 go, Well why you going to go to that trouble, we have this Coleman stove here.
1 B:  -- throw the grounds in, heat the water up.
1 B:  Well, I don't know how much you can learn.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  And then when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for
1 A:  -- and then the, the, uh, turtles try to eat up all my bait
1 [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] Oh.
0 feed them a little bit --
1 but we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, you
0 just be out on the water and looking around.  The peace and
1 B:  It's, you know, it's a game to her, but I, I do not like to do that
0 more, so we can't take it back [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell [child_crying] stuff
0 there.  The break ups?
1 B:  -- they don't seem to have a clue.
1 it a long time ago.
1 A:  Exactly.
0 A:  I know it.
0 B:  -- and that, uh, it obviously isn't working.
1 time he opens his mouth, he, he just lines up people against him so,
1 B:  Yeah, we're stuck with him for,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 interested in current events.
0 B:  -- and I read magazines, and such.
0 particularly interested in certain things of course, like all the news about
0 better than a lot of them, but, uh, but then again, who, you know, those
0 B:  [Laughter] The, um,
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  Well, people that are, um, have received sentences in jail, they have, uh,
0 about --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.
0 B:  You know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school --
0 B:  -- yeah, but, yeah, you know, right, right after you graduate from, um,
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
1 A:  Right, well, I tell you, I'm about a magazine junkie.  So this is right up
0 B:  -- pick one.
1 minutes and then you feel like you wasted your money, you know [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter].  
0 A:  [Laughter] Oh, well I'm afraid I'm not a woman's woman, by the looks of
1 this house I need to get a woman's woman in here to help me out [laughter].
0 B:  -- but it's interesting even with the everyday, you know, like the shampoos
1 B:  Well, I only do Maybelline mascara, because I think it's the best
1 A:  Oh, that's right, I forgot.  I wonder who has to listen to all this garbage
1 [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- or Dallas [laughter].  But, it's kind of interesting, isn't it?
0 B:  Well, that's fun.
0 B:  Okay, now I'm going to ask you your opinion of the, the perfume tear strips
1 A:  I've heard people are allergic to them or something.
1 B:  I use Lotus a lot just because I like [laughter] using Lotus [laughter].
1 B:  I tell them mommy is playing on the computer, so,
1 Lotus.  I, we've got a couple of word processing, but, I'd rather use Lotus
0 A:  Yeah.  Now we also, course of I use it for, uh, I have some check 
0 A:  -- all my checkbook's been on the computer for --
1 B:  -- I recognize these.
1 A:  Yeah, I don't have Tetris.  But boy, I'm glad, it's probably a good thing I
0 cool.
1 B:  -- it's really not [laughter].
1 A:  How about that --
1 B:  Oh, it's, it really is, it's like, um, amazing how this turned around
0 B:  That sounds pretty good.
0 shirts and T shirts do you make?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 I guess that's a hobby.
0 of it.  But, uh, you know, I read a little bit about it, and follow it on the
0 B:  Uh --
0 A:  But (( )).
0 B:  They don't, they won't,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Uh, one's real nice, but the other one is a, well, she's pretty wild.
1 A:  Wow.
0 B:  -- being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa. 
0 B:  Oh.
0 lift him and carry him every place he went.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old, and it just, you know, was
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 County, which is in the very center of the State of Pennsylvania,
0 had been so busy in my work in these last few years that I
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 froze to death [laughter].
1 always prepared and she'd bring along, you know, something,
1 anything, so we always had, 
1 B:  The Rocky Mountains are so much, uh, 
0 B:  Yeah, that's right.  I, I take it you haven't done a whole
0 A:  Okay, well what do you do on your yard?
0 mower so the, the particles fall down --

1 A:  Yeah, June bugs is what I'd heard them called, 
0 B:  Yeah, well, I had some of that problem, but mine was freeze.

0 A:  Good for you.  
1 B:  good job.
1 B:  Yes,
1 B:  -- and I love music.  I cannot carry a tune in a basket.
1 @A:  Well, good because,
0 A:  I thought, My goodness, I'm, I'm a definitely a beginner at golf.
1 that what I was doing was causing that little ball to do anything.
0 B:  Right.  Well, you got weekends.
0 A:  Where is that?
1 B:  -- but believe me, it's a lot of difference,
0 woodworking --
0 to try and make a lot of the stuff.  I got books on it and everything that
0 shows you step by step on how to do it --
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 did,
0 pants area, and drawers, and all sorts of things in there.  It's pretty (( )).

1 A:  I try not to, uh,
0 foot.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  -- uh,
1 A:  Oh, I guess, uh, this is a, a topic near and dear to my heart, 
1 @A:  since I am a, am a healthy eater,
1 B:  [Laughter] Well, I, I try to be as well,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 had, so,
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].

1 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- whatever you all call it --
1 getting hot, 
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] the weirdest, weirdest sensation, 
1 well, but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, uh, 
0 B:  I'm not really into what they're doing --
0 these, these, uh, supervisors running around, uh, having
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Right, well, I mean, you [child_talking] could tell just by,
0 B:  -- uh, and it was really revealing to see some of the, you know, the things
0 that go on, I guess, in some of these homes, so I would definitely,
0 B:  So I know how she feels about it.  You know, if I, uh --
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Is she,
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  She's relatively happy, but she doesn't like the food.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Okay, I'll let you start this time.
1 doing much garden work?  [Laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter]  No, mostly snow removal, 
1 B:  -- and [cough], and I just think it's ugly [laughter].
0 like, well, [laughter].
1 they just grow rocks and (( )).
0 A:  Are, are you, uh, able to get, uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain

0 and --
1 A:  -- and nearly ten thousand dollars of-, less than what the list price was.
0 money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord.
0 B:  Well, that's fantastic.  That's real, real good.
1 A:  So, uh, I have really been impressed.  I said, I probably never be able, 
0 A:  Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three
1 A:  I haven't had anything, 
0 B:  Oh dear [laughter].
1 in that car, and I can't get the light off, 
1 B:  And found it right away.
0 A:  -- and I said, I'll never find another one for that price.
0 that one.
1 WOMEN, too.
0 B:  I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed.
1 character on there.
0 B:  Yeah, I'm sure he will.
0 A:  He'll come back, show up at just the right moment.  
0 A:  Because I play lots of tennis and I'm gone a lot, so, I don't
0 A:  -- instead of,
0 shish kabob, 
1 I guess some, uh, some rice or something like that.  How does that
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 A:   Rome.  In, uh, 
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 you take, um, s-, little bit, maybe two tablespoons of butter and
0 read.  I've read more magazines then books and which is most
1 gee, I read a lot of books and [laughter], 
0 [laughter] and they're still stacked there [laughter].
1 A:   Oh.  Well, it seems like I have read a lot of children's books
1 so I have read more of those myself,
0 B:  to write the sequel which she did.  And,
0 close the door and just read, you know, and even stay up really
0 sleepy and I go to bed early.  So where I used to do that years
0 month and then a four month.  
1 A:   Oh.  
0 B:   Now is that like a classic?  
0 read in high school or something?  Or am I thinking of a different
0 A:   -- the President and everything.  And, uh, it really gets into
0 B:   {Very faint}  Oh, yeah.  
1 what [laughter] I've read,  
1 A:   [Laughter]. 
1 A:   Oh.  
0 of,
0 B:   Oh, uh-huh.  
1 all still take a nap [laughter], 
1 A:   What?  Do you want to start?  
0 B:   Well, yes, they will.  
0 A:  not, not if he's killed he can't, 
0 A:   Uh-huh, yeah.  Well, I, I guess I'm also looking at beyond
0 even that.  I, I, I guess I been thinking about it and I don't have
0 B:   Why, [sigh] you know, y-, y-, you could carry it to that if,
1 talking in my room [laughter], 
1 B:   or when people like look through my things in my bedroom 
1 B:   Yeah, mostly.
1 B:   Oh, I don't know.
1 B:   Well, I don't know [laughter].
1 youngest, I would pick up the phone and listen to theirs 
1 [laughter].
0 extension --
1 B:   But I stopped doing that a long time ago, 
1 B:   Oh, like, s-, yeah, this lady does that to me at work  
1 they stand right over you watching everything you do.
1 A:   Let's see, I can't think of anything else --
1 kids to bother me,
1 A:   Uh-huh.  Some days it's real, real bad here, and you would  
1 A:   you know.  But,
1 [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] They would have to chop down the door and get you out, I guess.
1 [laughter].
1 B:   [Laughter]  Yeah.  It takes a lot.
1 B:   I had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time 
1 A:   Well, did you have has name all over them?
1 B:   No [laughter].
0 upsetting.  I was mad about that and my privacy there.
1 Eagle, you know or,
0 A:   Right.  Exactly.
0 B:  and it's just, shoot the Indians, and they are always the
1 A:   It didn't, uh, it didn't have any real social bearing or,
1 B:   I gave up all my credit cards when I got my first divorce. 
0 and I about two months to find a job so in that interim everything,
0 instead of,
1 B:   You know I think if I had one I'd probably be maxed out 
0 A:   A lot of crime and,
1 service so I didn-, ha-, you know I had a lot to, I could leave 
0 good on Fox and Jacobs.  
0 A:   No.  
0 A:   Yeah.  
0 B:   I sur-, I sure wish they could build basements in homes in
0 A:   Uh, in parts.  I mean you couldn't, you really couldn't use it
1 A:   I think that's true.  
0 in it?  
1 a way is bad because then you, uh, you start to take pleasure in it
0 haven't given this matter enough thought.  
1 A:   Well, okay, that's, that's a very different issue.  
0 it a little too far was that they also check, um, if you are taking
1 A:   #(( )) substance?# 
0 MURPHY BROWN,
1 B:  Yeah, he has gone [laughter] to get it. 
0 A:  #I mean,# it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera #I guess.#
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  #tuned out of our T V.# 
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 is not quite that old.  But,
0 A:  #But, uh,# 
0 B:  Um, um, I guess it depends on what the nursing home is [laughter] like
0 A:  #Because,# 
1 B:  Uh-huh, and the kids I have to like drag them out of there too so,
1 A:  -- for nursing home insurance.  In fact, my husband and I take it
0 A:  Yes.  I have four.
0 state, I'm from Mississippi, I'm not sure where you're from.
0 lot of, uh, prob-, our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying
0 of, if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better
0 and then when, uh, the evaluation committees came through, they praised the
1 all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them.
0 they can't afford it.
0 ========================================================================
0 Golf Course, and then I've golfed a couple times, uh, at Chase Oaks --
1 A:  Baby.  Got,
0 B:  basically, uh, and, uh, had a golf pro and, and, uh, it was like maybe
1 long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every
0 B:   [Cough].  
0 golfing so that [noise],
0 A:   [Laughter]  Yeah, that's what they do here sometimes.  You
0 B:  And, uh, so I was basically just going around and doing what I could do
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, I didn't have, I don't have much knowledge of the systems but
0 B:  Have you tried any like the Chilton's, uh, manuals?  
0 going to be able to do myself.
0 B:  all that.  
0 A:  Yeah.   
1 A:  Huh.  
0 put on faces before.
1 B:  I trust people.  I'll do that.  Or do I keep on going, well, we'll wait and
0 it's, it doesn't work.
0 B:  And they probably do the same things.  
0 B:  But at the same time I, I agree.  I don't think we can do it and, and just,
0 A:  Right.   
1 B:  Well, you go first.  You called [laughter]. 
1 B:  I, I, I don't think so.  
0 A:  I mean the communists got it anyway.  
0 B:  Uh, [lipsmack] so, I, I don't know.  I, I'm glad, I nev-, I didn't have
1 A:  Huh.  Very sensible [laughter].  
0 B:  So I was in Phoenix.  Where were you?  
1 A:  and we were, we were very much minority [laughter].  
0 with, uh, ten thousand protesters that were, that were,
0 B:  You wonder about that sometimes.  
0 B:  Yes, we do.  
0 B:  Do you think that's a deterrent?  
0 stuff.  I've,
1 A:  Yeah.  Well, I wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one, 
1 A:  or right now but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.
0 without it back then?
1 B:  I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.
1 A:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  
1 A:  I always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually.
0 and explore something they haven't,
1 whining and,
1 A:  it's, I'm always looking for something better.  Uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  cars we have today with all the computers and everything.  
0 A:  I sure do.  I, uh, in fact, the last thing I have, I've done I, I don't
1 live in an apartment complex,
0 B:  I bet that was a lot of fun.  
1 A:  And so like the, the glove box was just a little,
1 A:  Oh, it was but,
0 you got to have or some, uh --
1 B:  because you didn't have all the extra, extra stuff,
0 B:  that's in there now.  
1 anything.
0 as, as much as I could,
0 A:  #Right.# 
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  #What, yeah.# 
0 more.  I said, Russ, you don't understand what it was like to have her home or
1 friends will come over.  In fact, everyday,
0 B:  #a month# --  
0 A:  #if I wanted# to, you know, d-, in fact, I still have offers, you know,
1 easy for me to fix.  
0 it over the drying rack.  
0 a year, but I, I don't like to just eat it.  It's, 
0 is so wonderful.  Everyone I serve it to that does not even care
0 something that long, [laughter] you know, you better get something
0 long time.  
0 a ways also then.  
0 B:   The, the first one is we need people in there that, that
1 A:   Sometimes called the dismal science.  
0 A:   ((Ma-, make them all)).  
0 A:   No causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for?
0 B:   -- should be able to do that, and be registered with what they
0 B:   I, I think to bring it in line you are going to have to have
0 B:   You take the gross national income  -- 
0 national income.  One thing we could do is give a ten percent
1 A:   I imagine it would be with seven, seven brothers and sisters. 
1 so, 
0 which is in, uh, northern Utah.  
0 Claus and he was the same Santa Claus year after year after year,
1 A:   [Cough]  Excuse me.  
0 A:   #different parts# of the country too.  
1 United States as well and we,  
1 B:   So, 
1 at halftime.  
1 quarter -- 
0 A:   And ((Morton)) Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal.  
0 A:   It's pretty much going between Washington.  They are
0 only lost twice and one of those was to Buffalo.  And they beat the
0 Dallas.  
0 B:   Yeah.  Well, also Houston is, uh, in Pittsburgh's division so,
1 B:   #I'll almost always# root against them.  
1 A:   [Laughter] (( )).

1 B:  You have to look for Yakima, Washington on some of the box labels --

0 A:  Yeah, so.
1 A:  Oh, really.
0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  No, I'm, I'm in Dallas --
1 B:  Well, like I said, good luck to you.
0 that we live in.  We have, um, three children, and, um, they attend the public
1 A:  -- sometimes I think, um, it would be nice to have a town home, with
0 young, young families with, with kids.  They're still doing, um, a lot of
0 all over the country, which we're from, um, the northeast, and, um,
0 in is very wooded.
1 B:  Uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here.
0 starting to lose, they're all falling now.
0 A:  That's right, that's right, they are.  I'm going to get the kids to get
0 guess the, the one aspect of it that I took in, uh, consideration is more
0 B:  Oh, yeah, I spoke to a person from Texas, too.
1 A:  Okay, yeah, I, I,
0 A:  I mean, like I used to be more, uh, conservative and just your basic
0 back.
0 great.
1 B:  Especially the STAR TELEGRAM.  I get that one.  It's, it's not the highest
0 A:  Yeah, I don't, I don't, and I pretty well read it, uh, I kind of, I mean, I
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  -- because it's like eight minutes of top news out of the whole half hour
0 B:  Oh, yeah, you go, against all that traffic, I guess --
0 A:  -- it takes forty-five or fifty minutes.
1 B:  Yeah, well my husband drives from here in Arlington to T I on Central
0 B:  Oh, yeah, uh, well, I didn't like it this week.  It was just all about
0 B:  Then I, then I'll really make a poi-, well, you know, it used to come on at
0 ten thirty, which was better, but then they put that silly ENTERTAINMENT
1 more money, or they, you know, or they wouldn't have it on at eleven
1 @@B:  -- but, uh, uh, well, I guess we've exhausted that subject [laughter].
0 A:  Well, I, I did, more or less, because I went in early that morning, okay --
0 check it, it was mine [laughter].
0 V highlights and also, uh, some of the news periodicals, uh, weekly magazines,
1 basically don't do it every day,
1 B:  -- of coverage, by the time you get the TIME MAG-, MAGAZINE,
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  there's nothing in it you don't know.
0 A:  It's historic events, huh.
0 are also, that we can see global events happening as, as they occur --
1 remember watching the World Series during the earthquake,
1 B:  -- and the, and the announcers, you know grabbing,
1 Is that what I-,
0 A:  How do you expect them to do this year?
1 live, you know, and, and the other one was country.
1 B:  [Laughter] So you didn't really have a lot of choice, did you.
1 A:  [Laughter] So, that's right.
0 But when you go to the ball park, it's really not all that far --
1 being, he was put in the, which I never knew existed, the Restaurant Hall of
0 A:  That's right --
0 A:  -- still doing excellent.
0 A:  Well, didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers?
1 A:  Okay, I have a cold this morning, so you have to excuse my, my sound here.
0 B:  Plano, Texas [laughter].
0 A:  Yes.
0 A:  -- um, who, who does, he's really an artist, and he does a wonderful,
0 A:  -- and, um, he does such a beautiful job, I'll take something in, I do
0 wonderful piece of art.
0 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
0 think that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit.  It's hurting, you
0 where they, where they have high industry.  So we're not the lone ranger here.
0 B:  -- kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Probably blowing up there to you guys [laughter].
1 A:  -- we probably get yours.
0 @A:  Bob.  Okay.  Uh, how, how do you feel about, uh, gun control, Bob?
0 weapons around.
1 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 or, uh, you know, uh, some of these are somebody's dating somebody's, uh, girl
0 B:  Well --
0 B:  Sure.
0 and everything else that, that is bad in our society, and, and we don't have

1 B:  Forever [laughter].
1 A:  #It took me,# it took me five years.
0 that biology class, and they just, they'd look at you like, do I know you? or

1 A:  Do you get, uh, a lot of tutoring, or.
1 class.
0 and, um, I don't know, I just feel like I'm, it's, it's going to take me a lot
0 A:  Well, now we pretty much just pay cash for --
0 A:  I see.
1 A:  -- forget it, I don't want that.
0 B:  Yeah, you can't say too much about it really.
0 information with a lot of people that.
0 B:  -- are saying it's like really, like, I think Joan Collins, I beli-,
0 A:  Yeah.  I guess, um, another thing comes to mind is some of the quote
0 B:  Well, they, they said that, it was suspicious behavior, and I looked at,
0 you know, while the highway patrolman pulled me back there, and, I, I think
1 B:  Well, I guess Cadillac.  I guess that's kind of everybody's dream
0 A:  Do you?
0 across the back of it.
0 B:  -- you know, they look like they're very sturdy, and [lipsmack] you don't
0 B:  Mostly Oldsmobiles.
1 still have the Cadillac but, uh,
0 A:  Oh, that's great --
0 B:  Oh, really.
1 A:  I honestly think I would die before my truck would,
1 write it down while I'm being creative, and it turns out wonderfully
0 in mind.  I can't remember exactly how I fixed it [lipsmack].  So, I've
1 B:  and I'm beginning to show it, too [laughter].
1 B:  Well, I've done that a couple of times not on purpose [laughter].
0 heard of that?
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- year after year after year.
0 A:  So, I think that we get a good deal --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 highways outside of what, metropolitan Dallas and Houston are okay?
1 A:  I don't know, I, I haven't been much, I haven't been much outside.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  Yeah.  How do you feel about, um, federal services and things?
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I know that we, uh, they ask us to bundle our newspapers, and we do that,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 container's a huge, green, monstrous thing that a, uh, uh, a special truck
0 doors on the side of it, and they throw the different stuff in the different
0 A:  Oh, they don't take vegetable cans.
0 B:  Just, just the aluminum pop cans.
1 B:  I would.
0 A:  I'm sure [laughter], you know, if nothing else call the sanitation
0 A:  Well, that's interesting.
0 A:  Well, what do you think?
0 York and California toget-, New York and Washington should I say --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  -- from guns.
1 A:  -- make it a requirement on them, on them gun stores, you would think
0 want to, you know, it's not going to matter to you if you have to wait a
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 get a gun, then they can go kill somebody, and then that'll be it.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  I don't think the gun control is going to help as far as, you know, just
0 A:  Well, I have a gun, you know, my -- 
1 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Oh, yeah.
1 A:  I think the only gun my son has is part of the Nintendo [laughter].

1 retriever, but he's a mutt.
0 B:  #Hands,# yes.
0 B:  They're pets [laughter].  I ride them some [laughter].
1 A:  -- and the three children have moved out and have their own homes and so
0 B:  Uh.
1 could go in the, in the barn with the pony --
1 only lasted about two years --
0 of always wonder, well where's, where's the money going?  [Laughter].
0 A:  -- topic is given to you.  
1 have as much time as I'd like to re-, sit and read the paper [laughter].  Um,
1 B:  I like, uh, I would like, probably like, I think I like the TODAY SHOW on
1 THIRTY-SOMETHING, which of course is not on the air any more unfortunately
1 was at a time when the kids are already in bed [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, I say violence and horror, I think --
1 A:  Yeah, that's --
0 A:  Yes, it is, it is, it is wonderful, and especially my eleven year old is
1 particularly enjoy but,
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 or if it's on at ten at night, well, I, I'm asleep by ten at night.
1 A:  I do too.
1 other like that, I hope we don't any way,
0 watch that DOOGIE HOWSER, but, uh, even that sometimes I have to shut it off
1 and say, it's,
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  We lived in the Chicago area at the time, and we had a lot of McDonalds --
1 A:  -- when they were first coming out.
1 B:  I, I know, I, I'm so sick of McDonalds,

1 B:  Well, we don't have any children, but we're going to have one next year
0 Mother's Day Out program --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  And, um, and another question to ask is if they're, um, state certified --
0 come to your own home when they're real little or --
0 A:  -- or something like that, and another consideration is how many infants or
1 A:  -- you know.  I'm sure that, um, whatever you decide, you'll be happy with.
0 A:  Yeah, I, I guess I have similarly broad tastes.  Um, my most recent, um,

1 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  -- and the BRADY BUNCH when I was little [laughter].  
0 B:  -- and, uh, uh, I guess the most, the most I look for is the, the tastiness
1 B:  Oh, well that's no mistake.
0 A:  Well, this one that I went to was Old Warsaw.
1 A:  Now if he does that,
1 A:  I'll go there at least once a month [laughter].

0 B:  -- and I really enjoyed that.
1 B:  -- and I was hesitant, and they all had seen it anyway.
1 B:  I, I love Julia Roberts movies, but I didn't think they were great for my
0 A:  Oh, the scary one?
1 B:  Yeah, that, that was, [laughter] that was.

1 B:  And then after you've been out a few times you just say, oh, well

0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 get to that point [laughter].
0 to it.  Maybe they should pay more attention to these trade, or, you know, to
0 A:  Of course, if somebody in, in China can make something for ten cents and we
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  He shot himself in the foot so many times [laughter].  
0 A:  Walk around.  
1 garage [laughter].
0 swimming --
1 B:  You don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees,  
1 B:  Hot tubs are not, uh, not too bad, but [laughter].  
0 A:  And I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that.  Why don't
0 she was wonderful except I thought that there were too many in the home and it
0 to stay home for a while until they were a little more, [breathing] uh,
0 A:  You know, and I know that one of the day cares and it's a, a well-known
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- experience there, that, you know, that they were good.  I --
1 B:  Yes, I am [laughter].  
0 A:  All right Sandra, uh, what we are supposed to talk about this morning are,

1 B:  Oh, yes.
0 mind, if it was myself, I would rather have my children inthat type of
0 in the market for a car for quite a while.
0 A:  Well, I'm a, I'm a traveling salesman.  I travel on the road so I like a
0 have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.  They always appear to hold well.
0 B:  And I had them do all four wheels. 
0 B:  That's true, yeah.  But, what is big today.  
0 B:  Uh, it's not as peppy as a, as a Town Car -- 
0 @B:  Well,  
1 A:  -- early fifties [laughter], so you should take my word you're young
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.

0 B:  And, uh, when I started work there in, it started, you know, actually going
1 days, two hours to get to work.
1 A:  That's, that's social change.  
1 A:  Okay.
0 A:  I think probably the big major change is the role of women.  
0 to be in political offices --
1 rights so that your wife gets equal pay, you can't make twice as much
1 A:  That's true, that's true [laughter].  
1 married and, and, I mean, not, not married, sorry, wrong word.

0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  [Static]  Oh, I want to see that one.  
1 A:  And it, it was a real good movie.  And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

0 movies, but I, we've rented some videos.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  No, not too often.  I, I hadn't been to the movies for a really long time

1 B:  Yeah.  
0 baby.  The husband was a dentist and he had murdered her.
0 B:  I,

0 often.  
0 you know, have a dinner and a program and renew acquaintances and,
0 A:   Oh, that's neat.  
1 organized.  
0 would, that would be great, but we tend to stick to the, call each
0 even recognize them sometimes, other than these, these times that
0 B:   So, do you have any with your extended family or is it mostly
1 A:   I don't know how we'd ever get all of our cousins together.  
0 B:   Uh-huh.  
0 were the activities the kids were -- 
0 now.  
0 A:   Uh-huh.  
0 A:   Yeah, kind of goes on.  
0 recipes, too many, uh, can this marriage with saved nonsense.  I,
1 of course, PEOPLE magazine is not, you know, one of your, uh,  
1 A:   your more intellectual magazines, but it's nice, light
1 B:   And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while [noise], so I guess 
1 to take me off their, their winning, you know, their list
0 B:   And I was real disappointed with it.  
0 B:   I, I don't know, it just, not enough stories with some
0 just, you know, doesn't seem to have enough story to it.  
0 A:   Oh, I see.  
0 mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me.  
0 really well.  
1 don't, you know, I don't, I'm not into, you know, recipes and 
1 eliminates, like three quarters of the magazine [laughter].  
1 beat it by hasty retreat,
0 B:  Those are, uh, plastic, is very recyclable and, uh, should be.  Uh, that's
0 A:  It's just a matter right now of who's going to take the time, uh, to do it.
0 where, uh, for your grass clippings, for example, if you don't put them in a
1 They, uh, bring out these ((Humpty Dump-,)) bins and you're supposed to
0 uh, dumping it in the dumpster, it's going to be a rude awakening to have to,
0 B:   And I was really, you know, unhappy about that situation.  I
0 that.  
0 A:   Right, right.  
1 B:  Not comfortably [laughter].  
1 B:  And so my, my parents couldn't believe it, you went camping [laughter].
0 B:  So, I guess I do like camping [laughter].  
0 B:  If you went to a different one every time, you couldn't see them all
1 B:  If I get invited, maybe, yeah.  
1 A:  [Laughter]  That sounds good.

1 line.
0 B:  Uh, no, they play in New York.

0 running smoothly, and to take care of the kids.  And, and then, uh, maybe
1 they lose it [laughter].
1 A:  They say, wow!  This is harder than I thought [laughter].  
0 oldest is eleven and I've pretty much been home, uh, since Brian was born and,
1 and I was home before three.
0 A:  -- but, uh, I have friends that, that have kids just starting kindergarten

0 A:  Oh. 
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah, she, she likes, uh, action movies and, uh, and, and comedies and so
1 B:  Keep her on the edge of her seat.  
1 A:  Yeah, they are.  Sometimes you're in the mood for it even.  
1 yourself or else,
0 you can always count on her to watch something like that [noise].  And she'll
1 B:  -- won't, they won't come within ten feet of,
1 B:  All the, all the ((ya)) [laughter].  
0 A:  Yeah.

0 B:  [Laughter] It's getting to the point where, you know, where, well, you
0 A:  Yeah.   It's really too bad.  
1 A:  Uh-huh, so you like the hits of today.  You're not really interested into
0 SNOWMAN and, course, I have children, so they like that, too.

0 B:   And, uh, let's see, that's GENERAL HOSPITAL, and then, uh, at
0 till almost nine o'clock -- 
1 A:   -- so I don't, I don't know some of those shows now, like I
1 KNOTS LANDING on Thursday nights,  
0 B:   Yeah.  
0 B:   Huh.  
0 because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any
0 B:   Well, we used to watch a lot of DESIGNING WOMEN, but, uh -- 
1 A:   They were all accusing each other of everything in the world
0 B:   Yeah.  
1 A:   Well, the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says [laughter].  
1 had a paint brush in my hand.
1 B:  Yeah, I don't think I'll attempt that myself.  I, I know I won't
0 A:  Listen, you got a great bargain.  For ten,  
1 B:  White, oh, no [laughter].  
0 B:  And it looks really pretty.  I love it.  It's just real feminine and just
0 A:  Yeah, I like wall upholstery, but now that's something I would never even
0 A:  You're kidding.  
0 B:  And just, staple it up there and staple your sheets up and then,
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  -- and I just hot glued it around the edge.  
0 because, uh, you want to.
0 B:  If they're not going to be on welfare or, or, or whatever.  They're going
0 back to Mexico just to find their way back.
0 they wanted to go home for Christmas.
1 A:  Well good [laughter].  
1 probably your husband, can get in [laughter].
1 B:  -- I know there's a lot of other people out there,  
1 A:  -- I've learned something from it.  
0 =======================================================================
0 B:  Yeah, you can't fix anything anymore.  You have to replace entire parts --
1 B:  -- or something.  You know, you can't, you know, back in the olden days
1 [laughter], 
1 A:  Want to fix my Thunderbird?  
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
1 can send people to the moon, 
0 B:  I'll tell you.  You know, the thing I'm worried about is, that's strictly
1 B:  Well, that's,  
1 know in the pasture grazing and there's not much fixing with them either.
0 ============================================================================
1 B:  Yes.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 one of, one of our other favorite things to do is to have pillow fights with
1 B:  He'd get on the floor and just,  
0 the physical, you know, loving and touching, that's, that's very important, I
0 A:  Yes, we do, we, well, like I say, we, the little community we live in, it's
1 winter a lot of time [laughter],
0 so tiny that --
0 A:  -- we didn't get a chance, but, uh, we've got the swings and had a
1 A:  Right, haven't been for twenty years myself but,   
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 I, I [lipsmack], I just love Tamayo.  And it's about thirty minutes north of,
0 B:  Well, I'd highly recommend it, particularly if you're Catholic.  I think
0 B:  Puerto Plotta.
0 A:  #Don't do it [laughter].#
0 about, uh,
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 because it has good effects.
0 A:  Well, that's why -- 
1 A:  It's a, like it's something you either just really want to do it or
0 B:  Yes, yes.  
0 A:  -- you know, no sense getting in arguments with anybody, about it.
0 Samantha, and everybody calls her him [laughter].
1 B:  Really?  
1 B:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah, I think dogs are less destructive than cats.  Cats tear up your
1 A:  They'd throw it and he'd be right there on it.  
1 B:  [Laughter] Did he ever go into the lake?  
1 A:  No [laughter].  
1 A:  [Breathing] Boy [laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 A:  Except it's windy. 
1 A:   You sound like me.  
1 them, I'll always have to be sure to carry a book with me
1 [laughter],  
1 crazy.  
1 sounds like heaven to her so she wouldn't have to,  
0 B:   -- and the rest of it, if I get to it, fine, if not,   
1 turn on the stereo and I'm just, I'm, I'm set for about an hour.  
0 A:   Well, I, uh, I don't know, I had bought books for years and
0 B:   All right.  
0 happen anytime soon.  
0 B:   I'm at grad school now in acoustics and all we do is metric
0 A:   Acoustics, uh.  
0 Because, I know, we do a lot of problems and things and they're
1 relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day. 
1 A:   [Laughter]. 
0 B:   Yeah, in the engineering they all do pretty much.  
0 B:   Yeah, they learn how many centimeters are in an inch and
1 B:   Right.  
0 A:   Ten votes or something.  
0 A:   Oh, you don't do that up there?  
1 B:   Uh-huh.  
1 A:   [Laughter]. 
1 A:   That's true.  
1 A:   -- which I usually am nowadays [laughter].  
0 ones, they just go ahead and count it by hand and -- 
0 A:   Oh. 
0 wasn't too hard a decision, because there was sort of no other
0 was there.  
0 A:   And, uh, it's, it's sad.  You know it, 
0 B:   Well, it is sad.  I think, I don't think for me it would be as
1 about that corporate umbrella -- 
1 thought would be so glamorous and exciting -- 
1 all of that out of my system,  
1 providing -- 
0 A:   -- and, dental and also, uh, retirement plan on a contributory
0 B:   And, you know, we definitely, you know, miss this.  I grew up
0 what it's like.  You, y-, it's on your mind twenty-four hours a 
0 day -- 
0 B:   -- we going to meet our -- 
1 B:   That's right.  
1 A:  -- I'm a single parent so I, 
0 B:  [Laughter].

0 B:  Oh.  Well, I, I'd like to learn how.  It's one of my goals [laughter].  
0 teach me how to cook, and I wasn't interested then --
0 A:  -- and then, once I moved out I miss her good food, and I
0 do any my, on, on my own.  I, other than waxing the car and keeping it clean,
1 A:  Yeah, that's really dirty work, isn't it?  
0 A:  Well, being a single person, I can't afford much, so I take mine to K-mart
1 A:  Well, car, car, that's, a car is never ending.  
1 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, right.  
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  At least a little while.  
1 A:  Least another year.  
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Yeah, me, too.  
0 B:  Sure do.  
0 A:  Oh, well, that's, you're lucky.  
0 I've only lived here for two years, but last year at this time, there was, we
0 were having snow and ice storms, and, I, I just, I can't, it's, it's, uh,
1 A:   That sounds fishy.  
1 A:   I don't guess you make any waves, though, do you.  
1 B:   No [laughter].  
1 got a dog who is sitting out there in the rain wishing I'd let him
0 A:   Oh, really?  
0 A:   Uh-huh.   
0 B:   Uh, yeah, he has a house.  
0 A:   -- have it a bed made on the little patio outside and -- 
1 now,  
1 B:   -- and when we got this dog, I didn't know what to do
1 what is the saying that you never really own a cat, that you,  
1 A:   -- an eight foot fence.  
0 B:   No [laughter].  That's a,  
0 B:   Yeah [laughter].  And I'll tell you [laughter] -- 
0 A:   -- is real good about letting you have them there so I,    
1 of time,  
1 A:   Get that mud up in your,  
1 tired.  
1 A:   I said, yeah, but I love it.  
0 A:   -- and I made some Christmas cut out figures that I put in the
1 them.  
1 okay.  
0 A:   But, for some reason, it just didn't really catch my thing,
1 now.  
1 A:   [Laughter]. 
1 A:   And daddy had a ball.  
0 A:   I took them out to a, a, uh, a little T-ball and that's, that,
1 was going on, but, you know. 
0 B:   [Laughter] Yeah.  
1 A:   Yeah.  And daddy loved it, too, I mean,   
1 B:   [Laughter]. 
1 A:   Well,  
1 A:   And they say it only takes thirteen hours to build.  
0 B:   Oh, that's good.  
0 A:   -- is okay, but -- 
0 B:   Yeah.  
1 will want to come to his house to play, you know [laughter]. 
1 to play with at our house.  
1 A:   But, oh, well.  
0 the, uh, engineers --
0 A:  Well, I sent these drawings, the rough draft over to drafting and I usually
1 A:   Oh, okay.  So you have a wardrobe to choose.  
1 B:   Yes [laughter].  
0 from season to season or is it pretty standard?  
0 B:   -- of course, in the winter, but,  
1 A:   -- my clothing doesn't need to be probably as fancy as yours
0 [laughter], but, uh, you know, mostly during the day I wear the,
0 A:   -- and cooler things in the summer, but I, [lipsmack], for my
0 husband, he wears pretty standard all year round because it's so
0 is, uh, we send all of his shirts and his slacks to the dry
1 A:   Well, we, uh, figure it's pretty much worth the expense
1 A:   Well, I guess you couldn't because you wouldn't have jeans on
0 B:   Yeah, yeah.  
0 A:   Yeah, uh, I wonder, should we wait until she comes on and, and
1 B:   Sure [laughter].  
1 B:   [Laughter]. 
1 A:   Hello?  
1 of patience [laughter] with it, too.  
1 now I don't think there is time to relax [laughter] so,  
0 B:   Not really.  
0 A:   Wow.  
0 A:   Oh. 
1 when I show her how to do an album, so, I don't know what day that
1 will be [laughter] but that's our next project.  
0 A:   [Laughter]. 
0 gold on it because my -- 
1 eighteen or so, uh, it would be important to know if it was a coed
0 or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they
0 like they need to go out and play all the time, not be [laughter]
1 A:   Yeah.
1 time, and it was sort of a, a rude awakening, 
1 The, uh, the defendant on, uh, the witness stand admitted he was guilty, 
0 in my life, and, and, uh, at the time I've been a legal assistant and nobody
1 wanted me on their jury [laughter], 
0 A:  Well, I, I understand what you're saying, and at the same time I'm afraid
1 came down from Mars.
1 A:   How about your community?  
1 B:   [Laughter] My community, that's cute.  
1 neighbor's about a half a mile at least,  
1 of dirt road to the concrete,  
1 B:   Hope-, hopefully, it's not my wife.  
1 A:   [Laughter]. 
0 that.  
0 A:   Well, it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it?  
1 B:   You know all that junk mail you get?  
1 B:   -- plus the other stuff that I, you know, happen to gather up. 
1 B:   I've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff.  
1 B:   He collects trash.  You know, and,  
0 A:   [Laughter]  Well, that's a full time job.   
1 B:  Well,
1 he is but,
1 B:  Oh, I'll stay for a million but,
0 B:  I don't even think it's America's pastime anymore.  I think football
0 enjoyable to watch than, uh, you know, football, than, than the pros.
0 A:  Yeah, then they got, then they got another -- 
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 kind of hobbled down the halls real slow.  Vulcans age a lot better
1 A:  Yeah, that's amazing.  
1 A:  Uh,  
1 A:  Huh, did you get to talk to him?  
0 A:  -- crowded.  
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  [Laughter] And nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
1 A:  But he's in a box, right?  
1 B:  Well, it is, well, actually it isn't.  Actually, the New York Giants
0 A:  Oh, right.  
0 B:  Yeah, where are you?

0 A:  It just seemed to me that everybody was just a half a step off.  I don't
0 A:  -- I've seen a few games [laughter].  
1 B:   Oh, I'll bet it is a good topic then.  
0 B:   I feel like we compromised, compromised until

0 B:   Oh, wow.  
0 B:   Oh, okay.  
1 A:   Oh, okay.  Well, this happened in Plano [laughter].

0 A:   And the one he was later involved in was the Texaco one.  
0 have to evaluate.  One being could he be a future threat to people. 
0 not like you go and say, you know, we, we recommend this
0 A:   Friday they went into deliberations, but -- 
1 believe it, I was like, what did I do, push the self destruct button here, 
0 tonight's my first solid food since Saturday [laughter].
1 A:  -- and then maybe we can gab a little when we get through.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  He saw the fish go flying through the air.  
0 A:  Yeah.
0 stomping down through the woods --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  -- as I started going, I realized I had something bigger than, than I was
0 equipped [laughter] for --
0 A:  And we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a
0 worst.  They've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year.
0 B:  We had a lot of bank robberies and different, lot of break ins and stuff.
0 trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the, uh, they're not nearly as
0 A:   Okay, do we just go ahead?  
1 that I liked the most and [noise] probably the one I liked most was
0 A:   The big one.  
1 B:   That's right.  
0 A:   Yeah.  
1 B:   Were you?  
0 B:   We like the motels, yes [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, warm [laughter]. 
0 B:  Oh, really?  
0 A:  Did you used to ski when you were in Utah?  
1 B:  I only skied once my whole life [laughter].  
0 B:  Oh, really?  
0 A:  You have to have like a [laughter] three seven to get in so, 
0 A:  Really?  
1 B:  Yeah, well, I can't, there are so many girls in all my classes, I
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- and in school he did terrible his, all his years because there was no
0 B:  Right, and, like, everybody, not just people with problems, uh, learn
0 A:  Um.  
1 minutes or an hour on.  I, 
0 A:  vaca-,   
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 seventy-two and, uh, [throat_clearing] uh, you know, I did the whole trip, uh,
1 airfare, uh, everything for less than a thousand dollars.
1 ten dollars a day.
0 A:  Well, and I've, I've, I've been to England several times since then.  Uh,
0 A:  Well, because, uh, we, I didn't go any farther north in Scotland than
0 A:  There are not as many tourists that go out there and I enjoyed, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory.  You know what tort
0 people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else.
0 A:  [Throat_clearing].
0 A:  See, I believe -- 
1 A:  Well, I, I happen to know a few and I even claim one as a friend.
1 A:  He's a divorce attorney.  
1 A:   -- and we also have a bird.  That's a strange combination
1 [laughter].  
1 cars will,  
1 A:   -- whether he followed some trick or treaters or,  
1 B:   Three weeks.  
1 B:   Too active.  
1 we named it Duchess and then we found out it was a boy.  
1 B:   Oh [laughter].  
0 A:   Oh, that's good.  
1 A:   -- yellow parakeet [laughter].  
1 B:   [Laughter]  That's a good bird name [laughter].  
0 A:   And so, yeah, we went out immediately and lifted up the hutch
1 A:   So that was quite a surprise and,  
1 A:   so we went from three bunnies to fifteen in a matter of two
0 now at the National Center for Voice and Speech that's located here at the
1 A:  Well, how do you feel about capital punishment?  
1 A:  Wow.  
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 A:  Right.  
1 B:  Yeah, so -- 
0 imagine, I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he
0 A:  That works.
0 B:  -- to prove that.  So,  
0 B:  Uh, yeah, this guy is up for the death penalty.  
0 B:  Uh, and in Texas there is, there is a couple of questions you have to ask,
0 A:  It was like last like year they had forty-nine so that's going up.
0 A:  Right.  
0 A:  Right.  
1 and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat
1 [laughter] or something like that.
0 cities and, you know, a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon
1 B:  Oh, I know.  
0 A:  It's about to get, you know -- 
1 rang.
0 B:  And so, uh, February is when I get the blocks and my husband has picked
0 A:  And it's, some of the stitches, you know, have come loose on it, but you
1 A:  No.  
0 B:  [Laughter]  And would you, uh, would it be appropriate to, uh, drink with
1 A:  Oh, all these hard questions [laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter]  Well, let's see.  Usually when we have a dinner party, I
0 Philadelphia cream cheese I think, is that what comes in --
0 A:  -- right?  
0 B:  I wouldn't be the big, uh, snotty kind.  
1 A:  I just started,
1 experiment with it probably.
0 A:  The Rangers, all right.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 though.
0 okay, but it was, it was inconsistent.
0 A:  Are you comfortable that Bobby Witt will be back, or is he ever going to
1 B:  I don't think he is.  
0 B:  I think they made a mis-, they made a mistake trading Buechele.
1 completely useless.
0 A:  Yeah, I mean something important I can't remember, but something about
1 A:  That's [laughter] right.  
1 A:  Or my glasses [laughter].  
0 A:  Well, that's, that's,  
1 A:  Yeah, oh, [laughter].  
0 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 A:  I guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling.
1 B:  -- my garage was just getting overwhelmed.  
1 you have to really, that are really dirty that you have to wash out
0 A:  Wasting all your time and effort and,
0 B:  #Thinking I was safe# in buying those jars as far as the environment was
0 B:  -- because -- 
1 double A batteries to toss out.
1 truck came by, well, we all ran out to watch it because, you know, we'd never
0 driver had something on his belt that he, uh, scanned across the little bar
0 A:  -- but, uh -- 
1 B:  Wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year
0 A:  But the garbage, uh, now there is just one garbage man that comes --
0 big green garbage thing got stolen.
0 extremely high.  I mean, something, I, I was amazed at.  Uh, uh, per year,
0 B:  #Taking#, taking one more life doesn't, doesn't, doesn't re-,
0 A:  Oh, really?  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Wow.  I think they're there, I think that capital punishment is, is, uh, in
1 B:  Yeah, I, I certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner, I know that
1 own meat, I think I'd become a vegetarian.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Uh-huh, so don't you think, again, it's a matter of opinion? 
1 something that I'm not interested in.
1 A:  No, but I read all about it, too.  
1 B:  [Laughter] Yeah, well,  
0 B:  HOOK, yes.  Again, I've heard mixed reviews on that, you know.  I think
0 B:  I know that was a classic, and I'm glad they didn't try to follow up with a
0 J-, well, Jeff Daniels is in that, too, isn't he?
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 ======================================================================
0 A:  I agree.  I think it just, it jams up the system and, you know, we spend
1 B:  No, no, I don't really mean that.  
0 and --
0 B:  Uh-huh. 
0 A:  You know, oh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  We have three cases going here in Dallas now.  
0 B:  And it was a, apparently, it went on over a year.  They were a very, 
1 somebody said, well, I'm in Arlington, Virginia [laughter].
1 @B:  Well, I guess I'd, I thought, well I guess I'd have to say the food
0 B:  You know, I don't like really noisy places and,
1 tiny little restaurant, everyone talked lower, they still seemed to have fun
1 restaurants.  Now that I have a daughter in college, and I'm going [laughter],
0 B:  I get tired of that, too [laughter].  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  And so I go to, I like Mexican food restaurants.  Uh,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Uh, we don't, I don't even think we have a Greek restaurant in Arlington
1 [laughter].
1 B:  Right,
1 A:  [Laughter] Oh. 
0 courses and it was thirty-nine dollars a dinner, but, my gosh, it was worth
1 A:  But, still, Brennan's is so lovely and the service is so wonderful
1 B:  Oh, wow.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Right now I have a eighty-seven Cavalier.  It's a piece of [laughter],
0 lot of the weekends --
1 like a brand new like Lamborghini [laughter].
1 because I'm a college, I'm in college and, uh, so I just give her the money
1 B:  Unless I win the lottery, I won't be driving,  
0 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Right, it never snows down here, so,   
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Uh, I haven't really thought about it.  I'm not too big on cars.  I mean, I
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  It was busy [laughter].  
0 A:  Right [laughter].  
0 A:  Where is that?  
0 island, with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic.
1 B:  Right, I mean, I wasn't a great asset to them or anything [laughter].
0 B:  And, uh, yep, and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old
1 A:  No.  
1 B:  Okay [laughter].  
0 B:  Oh.  
1 A:  Really?  
1 A:  Yeah, so you guys can actually get ahead [laughter].  
0 B:  Oh, okay.  
1 B:  -- getting older and, uh, not sure that's something I want to do.
1 thousand dollars on up to probably half a million.
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].  So, it's, that's the strange thing about, I guess, Dallas
1 then ran away, 
0 finally sold them because there were so many.
1 because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Then, uh, how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals
0 A:  Well, we have some laws on the books that, uh, don't allow convicted felons
1 B:  Yes, not an Uzi [laughter].  
0 A:  No, [laughter] no.  Uh, but I think a person needs a way of defending
1 B:  Yes, that's true,  
0 B:  Very fine, very,  
1 B:  No, they,  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  -- other than gossiping [laughter] about people [laughter].  
1 [laughter].
1 B:  -- never hurts to have a little refreshment involved, too.  
1 A:  [Laughter]  Right.  Well, it shows our age.  We have to be home by ten
1 anymore [laughter].
1 A:  I said, you'd think that we were seventy years old [laughter]. 
0 @@A:  Oh, do you?  
0 A:  Oh, what, uh,  
1 stay on the topic [laughter].
0 A:  And I record this, I will listen to our conversation tomorrow as it is --
0 don't look, even look at that.  I think they just don't even, I, I don't think
0 other areas that I've worked in, like in the chambers, they would just have
1 and, uh, that kind of thing can make and break, make or break you as you can
0 too, so, or not full time, but I work quite a bit and so --
1 A:  Yeah, I've had, I've had that frustration, too.  I -- 
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh, you know, I sort of can't get enough of this.  
0 that closed up [breathing] [throat_clearing].
0 B:  Yeah, a, a quarterback for the Broncos or for the, for the Cowboys.
0 B:  Right, yeah.  Uh, I, I have a question.  Uh, does, does the WALL STREET
0 B:  Oh, sit out by the little [breathing] (( )) beach.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 the second day I was up on the beginner's slope.
0 people are doing on the mountain, you know.
1 B:  And the good people make it look easy [laughter].  
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].  
1 B:  You're going, hey, how do I stand up?  
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  Well that's, 
0 A:  I haven't been water skiing.  
0 B:  Water, water skiing is a blast.  
0 A:  Well,  
0 B:  Yeah.  It, it wasn't that great of a cruise actually.  It was, it was seven
0 A:  Oh.  But I'll bet it was interesting out there on the boat in the water --
1 B:  -- though, because I got out of school for a week. 
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 that's probably going to increase.
0 subservient --
0 A:  I,  
0 A:  Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active
0 maternity leave --
1 B:  That's a bummer, though [laughter].  
0 A:  I think, 
0 A:  Right.  
1 A:  I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal
1 to, to see a little bit more of that and some ways, it might be kind of
1 A:  Oh, I didn't know that.  
1 B:  Very little. 
1 B:  -- because they don't want to know, they almost don't want to know us.
0 A:  [Laughter] They want to be with their friends.  How old are your kids?
1 and the other two, I'm not sure.  Well,
1 B:  Two s-, two, two, uh, uh, for sure are single.  
0 holidays,
0 B:  -- sometimes it's just spouse and me.  And, and you know what? 
0 A:  Right.  
0 B:  That becomes a drudgery and,
1 A:  How did they end up so far away?  
0 A:  Those are the youngest ones?  
0 A:  Boy, that's, those are a long way.  
1 A:  We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the
1 @B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Course, I know I watch my thirteen year old play now, you know, and it's
0 now seventy-one [breathing], I can remember her being, I believe a sixteen or
0 every, they'd leave work and go to a golf course, or a little country club
0 they belonged to back in Richmond, Virginia and just, uh, play nine holes of
0 good golf [laughter] sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family.
0 A:  I think I'm probably the same way.  Lessons do help.  I know ever year we
0 A:  -- and we always buy this weekend at a, at a country club in the hill
1 A:  That's super.  I haven't learned to hit the ball easy and I just sort of, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 when everyone's standing around watching you, I'd be [laughter],

0 A:  The very first ones, the little bell type things.  
0 A:  Well, what have you seen recently?  
1 @A:  I asked you first because I couldn't think of,  
0 B:  Well, let me see.  Uh, I guess the last one we saw at the movie was

0 B:  Yeah, it really is nice.
1 A:  They're, they, they're the type of thing you only want to have once
0 like, I'm not sure how it is where you are, but, you know, in the northern
0 B:  Yeah, and here --
0 A:  -- and the snow usually stays.
0 A:  Right.
0 =====================================================================
1 vocation, that's what I do for a living, 
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 guess I would be sort of pro --
0 could just dial an eight hundred number and, and run a check on someone.
0 become mentally unbalanced and use it --
0 =======================================================================
0 @A:  [Laughter] Oh, I'm not much of a cook, in fact, I'm standing here going
0 B:  Yeah, just the, the, you know, dip with the, oh, broccoli and cauliflower
0 and you know, things like that.
1 B:  Well, 
1 B:  As far as fancy recipes go, though --
1 cook.
1 B:  Oh, is that right.
1 B:  Oh.
1 B:  Oh.
1 A:  Oh, you're not.
1 A:  Well, no, hey, I tell you what, preparing a little pig is, is a snap,
0 A:  And after about six hours, you put the fire out and dig that baby out of
0 A:  This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds --
0 [laughter].#
1 B:  Oh, we, we just got lots of snow [laughter].
1 A:  So everything that lives around here is real tough [laughter].
0 twenty feet tall.
1 B:  If I had all the money I wanted, then that's whole different matter.
1 B:  Uh-huh, yeah me too [laughter].
0 A:  It did, huh.
1 B:  Yeah, they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same
0 perfectly happy with what I decided --
1 B:  Oh, well, it's, uh, it's worked.
1 A:  Yeah, I forgot the name of the town.  I thought maybe it was you
1 [laughter].
0 now, but I'm just speaking overall --
0 grade for instance, you may have an English class you may have half literature
1 so I probably can't [laughter].
1 as a child [breathing] reluctantly took piano #for,#
1 A:  Other than buy it #[laughter] prerecorded.#
0 B:  Well, they do have quite a bit of musical ability, which is, is nice.  Uh,
0 A:  Yeah, really.  Well, um, uh [throat_clearing] what was I going to ask?  I
0 A:  #Right.#
0 B:  -- so, my, uh, mother's physician --
0 A:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 B:  She was eighty-two at the time.
0 B:  -- and could call by name.
1 B:  Uh, no, uh, oh, several years before, well, it's a long thirty minute story
1 [laughter].
0 fell and broke her hip --
0 exception that I'll tell you about in a minute --
0 A:  Of a exercise program you have.
0 A:  It's the least hard on your body --
1 when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and --
1 A:  -- that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh, when you're in college, boy.
0 B:  Uh-huh, yeah.  Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred
1 the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years, but, uh, it's changed
1 places [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh --
1 A:  -- and do more [laughter].  
0 A:  -- just like eating right foods.
1 A:  I've tried to do that with sugar and, 
1 A:  -- #everything has sugar in it#.
1 A:  -- that's a problem, but.
0 A:  Uh, what topic would you like to discuss, political topic?
0 A:  Probably a lot.  I, 
0 people, uh, well, he's won a peace prize and,
1 A:  Well, I think that's one of the problems of being a Mister Nice Guy and, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.
0 jump on his band wagon, but, uh --
0 uh,
0 A:  -- that would jump on his band wagon --
1 you know, they were nothing.  You know, I mean, now it's all the blacks
0 A:  -- I, I don't know what, uh, times have changed, and I, I think that's one
0 my office.
0 sometimes I set there all evening.
1 B:  Oh, oh, me too.  
0 A:  -- yeah (( )) luck into it now, I think.
1 B:  No, me neither.
0 A:  Uh, do you feel like this is, I, I guess they're spending a billion or so a
0 A:  What do you think, Doug, of Mister Johnson?
0 abstinence, or --
0 couple of days, and then we visited a cousin in Dallas, just for a day, you
0 A:  Have you been to New England?
0 re-creation of Colonial items.
0 pretty there, and that's where he's want to grow, um, not grow, but live
0 because, you know, just all the historical things and,
1 A:  Well, it'd probably be better in the summertime when it's, 
1 B:  Wow, but [throat_clearing] yeah, I wish we could go and see that sometime
1 B:  Well, my favorite place to go is a little Chinese place called, um, China
0 A:  I had just moved back from Florida --
1 B:  Yeah, right, and, and then when you go home, you're still hungry
0 eat fast food much?
1 B:  I mean in a restaurant [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 week, and there's always just standing room only waiting to get in.
0 probably been within the last, oh, eight years that we've even had a McDonald.
1 A:  Got you your McDonald's, your Pizza Inn, your Taco Bell, 
0 A:  -- and Sonic, and all that.
1 A:  Well, that's yuppie food.
1 B:  Right [laughter].
0 B:  Oh.
1 A:  The good news is that I, uh, I, I don't have to eat bran muffins or jog.
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  -- but it takes three or four months to get in shape.  So.
1 A:  Well cool.  When I was growing up we had a dog.  One dog and [laughter],
1 should probably wait.
1 I didn't like cats at all.
0 B:  You can tell a dog to do something and it does it or you throw a ball and
1 B:  She doesn't really care too much.
0 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Right.
0 B:  Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short
0 A:  So that meant I was going to get married and a man was going to work and
0 B:  -- but even that she's planned on getting work.  What's good for her is she
0 A:  Yeah.  I wish they could come up with more jobs for women to stay home with
1 like I, like I think, 
0 A:  In the past I could understand why men got paid more than women, because
0 B:  Yeah, but that's --
0 B:  Yes.
0 think.
0 in their life, I think.
0 A:  Gee, like starting over, #I guess.#
0 I appreciate it.
0 A:  I, we [child_yelling] put two coats on it, and it's a small room, but I
0 B:  Yeah.  But you only had one can of paint that you --
1 B:  #Kind of fun, isn't it.#
0 A:  Yes.
1 A:  That's what I needed, and I didn't think about that.  I got a Mickey Mouse
0 B:  Yeah.
0 way around the room.
0 A:  Right.
0 do you have here --
0 A:  -- sort of state requirements.
0 but he had the freedom to wander around and, and help caring for himself, but
0 not eligible for Medicaid, and Medicare would not cover Alzheimer's.
1 B:  No, I'm in, I'm in graduate school right now [laughter].
1 through.
1 A:  Yeah [laughter] what you thought, huh.
0 know, it changed a whole lot.  I, I got to where I, I wanted to, uh,
0 students competing for the professor's attention --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Do you, do you worry, do you worry any about, uh, uh, being able,
1 B:  No.
0 A:  -- it's, it's, [laughter] it's kind of hard to set aside money and have
1 university.
1 A:  [Laughter]  And that, that your children can use the benefits of --
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 to take out some loans, and he's, he's working to pay those off.
0 A:  Yeah, Christmas time.
1 A:  -- six credit cards, yeah, and, uh, so I just charged a little on each
0 quite high generally.
0 eighteen --
0 I'm now up to, uh, seven thousand five hundred on it.
0 was just (( )) and go out and just --
0 B:  (( )) have you.  Well, I've heard, I think that one's sponsored by Sears if
1 A:  I was just going crazy.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 that's how I'm staying up.
0 B:  I either watch the news or, or occasionally I'll read the paper.
0 Like for example, the Kennedy, the Kennedy rape case.  The coverage on that
0 don't present the, the whole sides of, of everything.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the, like the
0 accurate and objective?
1 A:  Wish our post office could do that [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] I wish the post office would just stop raising our rates.
0 A:  #I agree.#
0 even if, you know, there's no life up there or anything, you know.  But who
0 A:  You know, let's go back to our original thing with, you know, our
0 threat.
0 A:  We went, uh, we took our grandsons and went, uh, the weekend before last,
0 B:  Well, maybe I need to run out there this weekend.
1 B:  Somewhere else.  
1 B:  Great [laughter].
1 B:  It was fantastic.
1 B:  Think we're straying off the weather, though.
1 A:  Yeah [laughter].
0 B:  -- did you see it.  They were saying, they were saying that was caused from
0 B:  -- at a restaurant out there, and they just, uh, I mean, the whole building
0 uh, you're near where I am.
0 B:  They came out of the ground because it was warmer.
0 A:  Uh-huh, huh.
1 B:  Uh, a bug's a bug.
1 B:  Maybe shut, shut down, shut down work, 
1 B:  I don't know about anybody else.
1 A:  -- or at least someone on the other side of the country so that you
0 A:  I've heard of it.
0 people stay in.  Those school districts that are not quality people who can
0 wants to go to?
0 education, um, that, that the teachers and, and such make.  How are they down
0 experimenting with that, but it hasn't really gotten going yet.
0 A:  -- specifically, you know, what they are doing.
0 front tires on at fifty thousand miles, but that car just purrs like the day
0 B:  Uh-huh, yours is a four door.
0 A:  -- uh, and, uh, and very happy with it, and I must admit it's, you know,
0 B:  [Cough]. 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And, you, well, you've got it, and, uh, so having precious cargo in the car
1 A:  Absolutely, 
1 thousand miles, and it's a seventy-four, I mean, an eighty-four.  So
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Send, send them to Wisconsin, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  Well, I don't think I could walk up sixty-eight flights of stairs
0 B:  And I go at a pretty good clip going down.
0 A:  -- when I bring it down.  I just can't do anything on my toes, because I
0 hurt my foot.  So, I just, I do the best I can.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  I just feel good whenever I exercise, feel so much better.  I'm getting
1 B:  [Laughter] What are you doing to train for that, just more aerobics?
1 B:  That, that's the major reason I'm walking up the stairs.
1 A:  Next week, after Christmas.
0 A:  [Laughter]  So, I'm going to go anyway, whether I'm up to it or not.
1 the heavy stuff, and I do all the fun stuff [laughter].
0 A:  -- but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed
0 A:  #I mean, I hate it# [laughter].
1 don't have to worry about any of that [laughter].
0 out of the north, it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.
0 A:  #On the# other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the
0 B:  Oh, that sounds so pretty.
1 B:  Oh really [laughter].
0 A:  -- one of the biggest in the area.
0 B:  It would be.  It would have been a total different one little soldier,
1 probably nineteen year old boy, decided whether Russia communism failed or
0 A:  What do you, what do you, what do you feel about capital punishment?
0 East, in one of those countries, if they catch you dealing in drugs, they cut
0 probably put a T V, probably put a T V in his cell and everything else just 
0 B:  Probably living better in jail than he would be if he was out on the
0 A:  And, you know, uh --
0 A:  That's true.  I'm surprised there's not more vigilante cases, you know, I
0 A:  Or, what if you're my age and your, your daughter was raped by someone and
1 when it comes to politics.
0 A:  Exactly.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- um, in my position, I, well in addition to that the local political
1 B:  It's not like any of this is any big secret --
0 had contributed to his campaign --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 the, 
1 B:  Uh, that was, I thought that was beautiful [laughter] justice.
0 is the same people go around, um, harboring their own racist, racist practices
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 of the Ku Klux Klan is pretty repulsive --
0 frontier, but, uh, I guess they're going, going pretty far into it now.  Um,
1 Star Wars is not too far [laughter] I don't think.
0 A:  Wow.
0 you had a chance?
1 it'd be real nervous.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  -- as far as me seeing it, you know, 
0 A:  with those little republican-, republics or whatever they splitting it
1 he's supposed to be on our side, isn't he.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
0 that, because that saves us lots --
0 A:  -- that's impressive he's able to do a job like that, because that requires
0 B:  Oh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  -- to admit that when the weather starts to get cold, 
1 baseball, 
0 B:  That's right.
0 A:  -- that's their biggest problem, boredom if they,
1 last week we heard him sing in the choir twice and, 
0 B:  Right.
0 uh, you know, I think, you, you just can't spend enough time with kids in, in
1 B:  Oh, it's beautiful.  It was beau-, in fact we purchased land up there
1 A:  -- we just went up and got our steaks [laughter].  I said, well.
0 A:  Well.
1 more pickups rather than cars.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] Awful.
0 A:  Uh, what did we pay?  Uh, by the time you get everything on there, it's
1 B:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  Well, they've got things,
1 A:  We also saw a real big moose, two moose,
1 vacant lot.
0 with Louisiana Downs.
1 B:  Well, yeah, but legally.
0 A:  Yeah, huh.
0 B:  Like, I want to go back.  But, it's, it's in the mountains, and I really
0 and I got married, and it was like, let's go to Fl-, let's, you know, let's go
1 work, you know.#
0 B:  #[Laughter]# #Yeah.#
1 well as it's supposed to #costs three times as much.  Right?#
0 He's on the other side of a hill.
1 A:  And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
0 B:  Oh, that's pretty good.
1 A:  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  You go ahead and start or I will, whichever you prefer.
1 that real regularly, but I am expecting right now, 
1 A:  -- just played a lot (( )).  I didn't have, I worked, so I didn't really
0 to do.  I did it, one to keep in shape and two just to, to not stress.  It's
0 B:  but, and also I, I know I feel a lot better when I do --
1 B:  -- and so it's just kind of, 
1 B:  Oh, gee, well, like the kids kind of keep me exercising too --
1 B:  -- just chasing after them, I guess.
1 B:  Oh, I know my husband wants me to take up golf.  
1 really bad.
1 A:  That's something I really enjoy, especially now that the snow's good this
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  -- skiers but, 
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter] Well.
0 A:  It's kind of how I did it, too.
0 B:  Oh, huh.
0 A:  Hopefully we'll make it through.  I'm getting married in May, so we're
0 A:  Well, thank you.  It's, it's fun.  It gives me more motive to exercise as
1 B:  Yeah.
1 @B:  You heard her in the background [laughter].  That's babies.
1 A:  Well, no, not [laughter] really.
1 creative, 
1 few times [laughter], 
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  I see.
0 B:  What size do you have now?
1 B:  Have you ever had it, uh, crack or break or leak. 
1 A:  No [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, I just have, you know, what they call community fish --
0 A:  -- well, no, they have breeders.
0 A:  Oh, they'll eat them.
0 ==========================================================================
0 B:  -- which is in East Texas.
0 and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that,
1 A:  All right.  And you got a lot of that in, huh?
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].
1 cards and stuff.
1 B:  -- curling iron.
0 A:  Okay, well, we're pretty close then.
1 B:  Obviously I'm not calling often enough [laughter].
1 I see them all.  I see the junk ones by myself, and I see the good ones with
0 A:  -- and all the, uh, strong R rated, and my wife and I go see the, the MY
1 GIRLS and the good ones [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter] Well, I'm ready if you are.

0 until seven, and I'll just, uh, leave the office at five, go to a movie, and
0 matinees are.
1 movies.
0 A:  And, uh, we're just offering a, a new card that gives you on-, up to one
0 B:  Unfortunately, I use my Discover card more than I ought to.  Not a great
1 A:  And it's one percent, so you spend about five thousand.
0 A:  That's pretty good.
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 A:  I, uh.  They're in the, in the head of the division and just won the last
0 ejected Carl and then he got a, he got a ten thousand dollar fine and one game
1 paper probably, or a sports page in [noise] I venture to say in about a month
0 A:  Oh, is that right?
1 A:  What do you think about that?  Do you think he got what he deserved, or
0 so, so, uh, I've thought about this more than once, uh, you know, dealing with
0 A:  -- and, uh, that's what we went through.  Uh, up to a point things seemed
0 A:  -- and they did not know how to take care of that, and then, um, at that
0 B:  Definitely.  You know, one of the other subjects on the switchboard, and
0 should do a community service type work.  This would be an excellent example
0 the sentencing, but I do agree with trial, trial by jury.  I just think that's
0 A:  -- that makes it look like he's standing in the clouds and, 
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Oh.
1 B:  Oh, uh-huh.
1 B:  I tend to like the more mellow.  My husband likes, uh, harder, loud
1 A:  Me too, I'm an older person [laughter],
1 B:  Well, I'm starting to sound like my mom [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah --
0 B:  Well, I know they talk about, um, all these rappers now.
1 B:  Do you like the rap?  [Laughter].
1 B:  Oh, did you.  Oh.
1 B:  Oh, it's quite, quite big, huh.
1 B:  Quite large, huh.  
0 B:  Oh, did you.
1 I mean, we're talking real roughing it, no cabin, no johns, nothing. 
0 A:  -- but I did not go on the backpack.  I'm, uh, my back wouldn't allow me to
1 Scout way, and he came back tired and wore out [laughter].
0 A:  -- and that's not very rough at all.  You have electricity and running
1 A:  You mentioned the word rough.  My idea of rough, 
1 choose from [laughter].
1 A:  And she feels like she's being imposed upon.
0 A:  Uh, we've gone cabin camping in Colorado --
1 would even consider going to a tent camp again at all.  It's just,
1 A:  -- and without thinking I picked up a stick and threw it at him --
1 A:  It turned around, and if a skunk can give you a dirty look, it did.
1 A:  I said, I done made a mistake. 
1 then wandered on off, very, very slowly.
1 A:  And my wife and children headed for the nearest tent to (( )).
0 B:  [Laughter]  Oh, no.
0 like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and
0 B:  Yeah, but you know, that's like them being enthralled with our football and
1 A:  Oh, once you st-, I don't like to get one of her books because, 
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  I, I just live to read.  I'll, I'll skip everything just to get back to
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  Well, it was around here last night, I'll tell you that [laughter].
0 B:  Um.
0 A:  If it keeps on raining like this, and I understand it's supposed to rain
1 B:  -- and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather [throat_clearing] so, 
0 B:  Well, now, I wouldn't call it danger.  This is, uh, this really isn't bad
0 A:  Oh, yes.  Well, we moved actually down here from another location, and it's
1 B:  Spectacular is a good word for them [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Beautiful area.
1 B:  Well, not really, 
0 B:  Yeah.
1 it's, uh, in fact, I've, I've played golf on, on, uh, New Year's Day one year.
0 snow in January --
0 ======================================================================
0 B:  How about yourself?
1 weekend in the summertime.  It was just more fun than a barrel of monkeys.
0 to it like the,
0 A:  Well, now, sure.  I've been (( )) whenever it was just horrendous, I mean
0 A:  -- (( )) it's wonderful.
1 to pay upkeep on it, or any [laughter],
1 B:  [Laughter].  
1 B:  I've never heard that one.  I suppose that's probably true, so.
1 way to go, uh, nowhere fast,
1 A:  to go, to go nowhere at very slow speeds at very great expense.
1 were, um, probably eight to ten foot little skiffs that were a lot more fun
0 how it, maybe like roller skating would be.  It looks like a lot of fun --
0 B:  Uh-huh.  Have you ever surfed?
1 don't know, the idea of having to commute,
0 B:  Freezing.
1 rain.
0 A:  What, is it warm but wet up there?
0 you know, takes,
0 twentieth, and we had our freeze this year on November second, and between the
0 B:  Uh-huh [laughter].
1 A:  -- the size of my yard is decreasing in proportion to my age.
0 A:  -- rather than, uh --
0 we're just going to do in the flower beds and the whole yard.
0 A:  Did you all really?  Oh I had those in house number two, and it cost me a
0 A:  So, my, yes.
1 thought well, we're just going to kind of, I guess, take our chances and hope
1 for [laughter] end up, 
1 A:  You listen to Neil Sperry, too, right.
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].
0 They say that's the best time to do it, and we did it then, and we had Indian
0 nursery, and we had lifetime guarantees, so we just got new plants --
0 should have insurance benefits and profit sharing and retirement funds, like
0 more companies have like dental care --
0 kind of call an in-house day care center, where the mothers can come and leave
0 B:  So that's a new innovation, too, for a benefit.
0 They preached job security --
0 competitive.  Perhaps we've, uh, uh, been, uh, we were too used to off time,
0 B:  -- uh, you know, social security again, most of the young people today are
0 A:  I heard that all my life there wasn't going to be any when I was on it --
0 A:  Okay, well, I don't see many of the current movies.  I usually wait until
0 did go to see last weekend STAR TREK SIX.
1 wouldn't go so far to say that we're trekkies but we, 
1 and they, the cast, they're getting pretty old. I don't know, 
1 A:  I'm not, but my husband is, and he went last weekend to see it too
0 B:  -- and had waited until it came, you know, out on video, and then rented it
1 B:  Oh, did you?
0 A:  -- and, um, I, I suspect it'll be a full priced theater when this highway
0 A:  He said it was like seven fifty a person.
1 then.
1 current movies I don't know what's going on but, 
1 the Challenger,
0 tragic, and yet eventually it had to happen, I mean, it had gotten to the
1 A:  Yeah I well,
0 spectacular.

0 B:  I've, well, I've been home with a, um, I have a baby, and --
0 A:  I, well, I don't, because I work all day.  
0 B:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 A:  -- but, um, I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around
1 B:  Oh, I don't get into them that much.
1 B:  Well, 
1 B:  Yeah, well, they're not entertained for too long with it.  He's, 
1 there's some real weird people that, 
0 think.
0 all the time, but until you've really seen it, it does-, it doesn't really hit
0 kind of fun.
0 @B:  Well, um, done a little, uh, repair on the, uh, shingles on the roof
0 B:  Uh, we did have a little bit of rain yesterday.  So far we haven't had any

0 A:  Oh.
0 B:  -- on, you know, on the kid's, um, shirt.
0 A:  Boy, that is something.
1 said, you'll probably have about fifty more orders from all the teachers

0 A:  Well, how fun.
0 B:  -- and, um, [lipsmack] and I do fabric in baskets a lot --
1 B:  Well, it's, it's called, talent with a hot glue gun, you know.

0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  -- but the problem with these nursing homes is [throat_clearing] the cost
1 A:  Right [laughter].
0 B:  -- and, uh, uh, I really need to know more about it.
0 A:  -- to handle my grandma as well as, as well as, um, the rest of the family.
0 just lose even more than what they had before.
1 B:  Yeah, well hopefully, 
0 A:  I, I really don't, to be honest with you.  I'm just saying, I've done some
0 qualifications, I don't know other than three square meals a day --
0 I've sung a lot, and so almost every Christmas and every holiday you can think
0 A:  Well, in, in the mountains up in Utah or where?
0 A:  But, we, we have boys that'll go there in July, and they'll go up there for
0 B:  But we weren't over in that part of the world --
0 B:  How about yourself?  Where do you, where do you like to go to vacation?
0 A:  I just as soon would, would travel, you know, on the ground, um.
0 B:  I'm a, I'm a Boy Scout leader so I'm out backpacking, camping quite a bit,
0 too.
1 B:  -- and then in a week Mom and I agreed to chaperon my son's, 
1 B:  But if you don't like to fly, then [laughter].
0 A:  So we kind of got different ball game but, uh.
1 A:  [Throat_clearing] What, uh, do you feel like you have any time, 
1 B:  That's true [laughter].
0 A:  Right.
1 B:  Uh-huh [laughter].
1 B:  And, um, so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school
1 started helping, too, you know.
1 B:  Uh-huh, and there's always a few people in the family that, when they stare
1 A:  Yes, and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right?
1 A:  -- doing something.
1 A:  You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you.
0 guess, um, theories that they kind of pulled together in kind of a, um, pretty
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 anything else I've seen lately.  I mean, I, I, I'm a big movie fan, so, I
0 place.  It doesn't, uh, bother your, my back as much, and, but I, it's hard,

1 A:  Uh, I don't even remember the name of it any more [laughter],
0 A:  Yes, uh-huh.
1 A:  Oh, my word.  And how old, you have a longevity, don't you, in your family

1 A:  Oh, oh, you're just a youngster then [laughter].
0 people can't either --
0 B:  Extremely.  I carry tear gas.
1 A:  Oh.
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  Well, the one person who might snort cocaine in town probably isn't very
1 violent [laughter].
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  No, no, they're from, oh, from the communities around us --
0 B:  -- that, uh, I used to have the windows replaced on that that I say,
0 they don't catch a lot of things.
0 B:  -- that they wouldn't know.
0 A:  Oh, well do you, um, do you have signs posted that, you know, say,
1 B:  They're lies, but, you know,
0 every fourth or fifth person they've diagnosed with AIDS, has got a new
0 B:  I don't know how much he's going to, you know, actually, see I'm just a
0 B:  -- it just, you know, I don't know, I mean,
1 A:  All right [laughter].
0 as well as just, the general type of education that the school gives.
1 B:  Yeah, but what we didn't consider was coming back and forth and things like
1 that [laughter] you know.
0 [laughter].
1 A:  You learn to appreciate what you had [laughter].
0 A:  Yeah, and it was --
1 A:  Oh, cool.
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  She was the only twirler they've ever had.
0 A:  Great.
0 everything, they really spoiled everybody here at school.  We all are.
1 A:  Meow, meow cats.
0 in the newspaper free kittens, and, and nobody would come over and do
0 for feline leukemia, but back when this cat died, which was, oh, some ten
0 one got corrected the dog, and we saved the dog, thank goodness, it just, it
1 watch cats or anything, but I tell you what, we don't have any mice or, 
1 A:  -- and they'll leave us a present on the back or front step,
1 B:  -- but I just, I was wiped out there for, 
0 A:  -- and then they right it off, but to that advantage they gets --
1 B:  Well, it's uh, the interest rates are still crazy up there, you know, 
0 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].
0 A:  Absolutely, I just, you know, I think that if you're doing that you're
1 damn thing so, 
0 not going to use it, for example, like you said, with a Visa card really you
0 A:  -- I think a lot of times, especially, like I'm a student, so I don't have
1 for all that, 
0 A:  Okay, all set.
1 B:  Good morning [laughter].
1 B:  Really, that's too bad [laughter].
0 A:  Wow.
1 B:  -- and using up all my nighttimes,
1 B:  You have one that often.
0 B:  Oh.
1 A:  we really do.  You know, you get your little Sousa book and you just
1 B:  Because about the best I can normally hope for is about fifty --
0 B:  Well, I declare. 
0 A:  Um, but we do get an awful lot of music, you know, we can borrow music from
1 B:  Well, I, I work the same way [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, I, I, I think [clicking] my involvement in, in school got him in
0 basically draw, draw the design of whatever it is you want --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  Oh, do you save a lot of money rather than buying the finished project?
0 B:  Uh, I've made a, it's a, it's a table that has a shelf underneath.
1 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  [Laughter].
0 stores to buy very often.
0 A:  Uh, let's see.  Personal computers.
1 yet.  So it's,
0 B:  Yes.
1 A:  Yeah, everybody tells me they're angels, so, you know, 
0 A:  Yeah, yeah.
1 B:  -- for that enchilada dinner.  Nice and cheap.
1 fifteen or twenty years.
0 A:  #No I haven't,# I've never been there.
1 B:  It's our big, it's our big end of the year splurge,
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 wonderful.  Right.
1 A:  -- yes, I think so.
0 B:  -- because they can't be any better than they're going to be.
1 B:  because I walk in and everybody says, Well, hi Mrs Bush, how are you.
0 to go there just because it's nice to really be cuddled, and that's what I
0 a few minutes because we're fixing to do another birthday.  Well, it's 
1 like,
1 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 little shops and candy shops and, it's, it's really neat.  I don't think, uh,
0 humid, so you have probably a lot of green, and lot of real pretty things.
1 the phone.
1 B:  Oh, yeah, me too, uh, me too.  Unless I'm going somewhere warm 
0 B:  -- for the winter [laughter].
0 B:  Well, fortunately, my children are pretty much beyond that [laughter].
1 A:  Mine are too, 
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 know, when somebody would decide to quit or something, I always felt real
0 B:  But, I always seemed to manage to find somebody that I felt was just as
0 A:  -- and take it in the cold to someone early in the morning.
0 A:  In a home?
0 lot of the girls here go off as nannies --
0 A:  But, uh, I think that'd be an ideal situation.  I've never had to, to, uh,
1 A:  Right.  Well there was seventeen years between them but, 
1 boys and a girl --
1 A:  So, but, uh, we have fourteen grandchildren so, 
0 @B:  -- and is it adequate [laughter].  I think that's so varied, depending on,
1 young child anyway, they're not, 
0 twenty-four and my youngest brother is six.
1 B:  Oh.
1 A:  [Laughter].
1 telephone right now #[laughter].#
1 A:  How old is the little one?
1 A:  Oh, boy.  Keeps #you,# 
0 A:  Um, when I was growing up there wasn't a whole lot.  Most of our one on one
0 B:  #Must# have kept your mom busy [child_talking].
0 B:  Do you have children in school?
1 B:  And cipher #[laughter].#
1 A:  Huh.
0 counting system.
0 B:  -- that sort of thing.
0 A:  Oh, do you travel a #lot?#
0 then, and that's about the only time I read them so #[laughter],#
0 A:  #Oh.#
0 see it, #so.#
1 B:  Well, I read about one page, and then #I'm asleep, so I don't get very,# 
0 application in with American right now for flight attendant, actually, so --
1 B:  [Lipsmack] So we'll see.  But American's the best so #[laughter].#
1 B:  Trying to hold out for that #[laughter].#
1 A:  #[Laughter] Oh.#
0 B:  Probably,
0 B:  -- besides Presbyterian, so it, it stays pretty interesting that way.
1 B:  -- I keep learning then #[laughter].#
0 B:  Uh-huh.  What age are your children?
0 them [noise].
0 B:  No, not really.  We, uh, haven't had that much, you know, problem with
0 or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time, so it #seems# --
0 A:  Oh, you're a,
0 B:  -- more.  
1 A:  My mom would have probably ripped the radio off the,
0 B:  No, that w-, that [breathing] is not what one needs to do either.  You'll
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  I'm a, I'm a Clint Black fan.  
1 B:  How about George Strait?  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Have you gone to, uh, Garth's concert?  
1 A:  Yeah.  
1 B:  Yeah, but she thinks she's young [laughter].  
0 B:  Um, but don't, don't you find that that sort of imposes a, uh, I mean, it,
0 A:  -- agency?  
0 them.  Uh, but, but I suppose that has, uh, some, some negative side effects,
1 @B:  Uh, well, I, I do, uh, real rough type camping.  I have a motor home
1 A:  Huh, rough type, huh [laughter]?  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  That's great.  
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  So [laughter],
0 A:  It was a lot of fun.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 that's my first trip back in, oh, goodness, um, um, thirty years maybe
0 A:  Do they still have the, uh, the scenic, uh, roadways that cut through the
0 A:  Oh, yeah.  
1 B:  I don't know why I got stuck down here in Texas now [laughter].
0 B:  Not around here [noise]. 
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  And I was actually on the road a little more than three weeks. 
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 Francisco.
0 B:  And, uh, and then cut across through the wine country.  
0 =========================================================================
1 B:  Never heard of them [laughter].  
0 fairly well for, for a new team.  They, I think out of the last like eleven
1 B:  -- we'll hear of them more often [laughter].  
0 B:  Yes, she likes it a lot, yeah.  
0 anything I #know about basketball.#
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah but,
1 B:  -- to get that ball up in that basket [laughter] so,
1 B:  So that was pretty fun to see the improvement.  
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Oh. 
0 B:  And when I was in high school I was a twirler and so -- 
1 A:  Well, it seems like, I don't know, basketball may be, I don't know if that
1 B:  -- exactly what went wrong, you know [laughter].  
1 A:  Uh, well, uh, the Cowboys are my favorite team.  That's pretty easy to say
1 nowadays [laughter].
1 Johnson fan.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  -- and I guess I still have a soft spot.  I just hate that that's the coach
1 B:  I'll bet they are.  
1 mister nice guys like they used to be.
0 A:  Right, yeah, Troy Aikman, he got hurt at O U, so he transferred --
0 B:  Right.  
1 A:  I'm watching them on T V right now.  But they're doing some stomping on
0 A:  Really?  Well, they're doing good tonight.  
0 B:  It's, it's not just antilock brake.  I think that's already on most of
0 B:  Mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much [laughter].
0 B:  Oh, no.  
0 A:  had themselves a ball for about an hour [laughter].  
0 think their personnel policies have been a little misguided lately.  Uh, I
0 A:  Well, the problem with the Rangers is they've got a lot of offense, they
0 and manager Bobby Valentine didn't come along so --
1 A:  Yeah, I think he's history.  
0 A:  Detroit.  
0 B:  Oh, they released him really, didn't they.  
1 B:  You don't listen to it [laughter] twenty-four hours.  
0 Lake City and it's an all news or an all talk station also.  It doesn't have
0 A:  Well, you know, I think there's a lot of that in the newspaper reporting,
1 too.  #I think,#
0 it and it doesn't always match up.  So,
1 B:  -- and Yeltsin is already there sitting there [laughter].  
0 B:  We lost the second major newspaper in Dallas within this month.
0 A:  Oh. 
1 B:  So I feel sorry for all the liberals in town.  They have to,
1 the deficit right now, and if they were to administer this, they would, uh,
0 would only answer to, to the government to a big bur-, bureaucratic mess.
0 B:  -- in the country, maybe something about halfway between that and what we
1 B:  I'm opinionated.  
0 A:  -- and, uh, we did spend a lot of time with our children.  They were, we
1 B:  Had to have something to even it out.  
0 A:  Pardon?  
0 B:  Well, we have animals and we have chickens and dogs and cats and #birds 
0 A:  Oh. 
1 B:  -- I just got out of the shower.  
0 A:  Well, uh, since they reinstated the death penalty, was it about seven or
0 B:  No.  Is, what's the death penalty in Mississippi?
0 within the, the prison.
0 SOUTHERN LIVING and COUNTRY LIVING and --
1 A:  -- and, uh, oh, my wife has a whole ton of them she subscribes to
0 A:  They can be responsive, too.  I know this summer U S NEWS was going to
0 that they weren't going to do --
0 changing events.
0 A:  So -- 
1 A:  I'm just,
1 A:  And, uh, the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what
0 B:  I guess, I,
0 B:  -- anymore, uh,
0 B:  Yeah, I think that probably does have, have something to do with it, and
1 B:  Yes, we're not too long distance today.  
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 A:  All right.  
1 B:  Learned about their basketball team [laughter].  
0 B:  Nancy.  
1 B:  I'm a nurse and I -- 
0 B:  So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance and I, I make
0 A:  Oh. 
0 A:  Right, well I guess that's a good point, uh,
0 employed and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've
1 B:  Then I think it makes a big difference.  
0 B:  Right.   
1 B:  Oh, well, I guess,
1 B:  retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  Uh,
0 A:  -- but still, those aren't real high powered.  They're just, you know,
0 A:  -- armor piercing ammunition.  
0 B:  The Glock?  
0 A:  Oh. 
0 A:  Do you have any other reunions?  
0 the time.
1 B:  No, we just goof off.  
1 A:  Oh [laughter].  
0 and,
0 A:  And then w-, we'll sell chances on it and then -- 
1 B:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  
0 B:  [Static]  Huh.  
1 A:  Kind of a heavy topic tonight right,  
0 B:  Um.  
0 B:  Course, you know, it was much more publicized in the sixties.  I don't even
1 throw up their arms about it and go, I'm going to Harvard and I, you know,
1 [laughter] --
0 A:  You know, just the difference in the technologies in the two countries, the
0 otherwise they wouldn't be able to get out and do.
1 of necessity.  Just repairing things around the house.
1 B:  It's, it's also a way of relieving stress.  My wife kind of laughs,
0 B:  And it's, uh,
0 A:  And, uh, casings and so forth that are, that are real nice, so that's,
0 that's good.  That's good.
1 B:  But what I need next is a good table saw.  
1 B:  -- basements were, were common and,
0 I'd, I'd kind of like to, to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say, a
1 was Cowboys versus Oilers in the Super Bowl [static].
0 [static], had a decent chance at it.
1 A:  Well, he, he had himself a good contract.  
0 day.  He rallied the team down from seventeen points in the middle of the
1 disaster.
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 so that my wife could stay home with our two boys now.
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  -- to commute back and forth to work and it has been, it almost has two
1 B:  Ow. 
1 A:  [Laughter].  
1 A:  I don't think they make them that big.  
1 it's hard to find a car that is big enough.  I guess,
0 A:  -- when we bought it we, we didn't get the bench seat -- 
0 A:  -- up front, so,
0 A:  That's true, I haven't, I haven't thought about that because, is there a
0 got two sizes of mini vans.
1 B:  Well, they make us wait to get married in most states I know [laughter].
1 B:  -- and the kids have BB -s [laughter].  
1 birds steal my dog's bird, dog food.
0 B:  My, I don't think that's fair.  
1 A:  Oh, my heck.  
1 A:  No.  
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 and these places that the government comes in and takes over, China, don't you
0 where did they come from?
0 B:  I don't know.  
0 B:  Well [breathing], you know, one thing about the Killeen situation that was
1 B:  -- that was a joke, it was a joke [laughter].  
0 because I know people are in there with them on.
1 A:  That you're in the bar and somebody has a gun next to you.  
1 B:  Yeah [laughter].  
1 A:  So, uh, what do you think about child care [laughter].  
0 B:  Oh. 
0 A:  Course, like I said, I took her two days a week and maybe that was, my main
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  But, I think for taking kids to a, probably people that take them to, uh,
0 ==========================================================================
0 A:  Well, I think here in Dallas we've got, uh, it's greater than that.  I
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 boys and it's just getting so bad around here that I'm afraid to even let them
0 B:  Yeah, why don't you, why don't we, why don't you do about thirty seconds
0 have, uh, an X T and then recently we, we made a, the command decision to go
0 ahead and get, uh, the absolute top of the line because spouse is a, uh,
1 B:  And so we got one that,
1 B:  No, no.  
1 misuse the word so,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 of giving back a portion of what He's given to us.
1 you bet, boss, seeing as he was the one that, uh,
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 Airlines.
0 B:  Extremely expensive, though.  
0 where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was
0 B:  Yeah, but in any event, uh, I'm in favor of national health. 
1 B:  -- to vote for it.  
0 wait and have a pick up, least of paper, but they don't pick up the other
0 B:  And see how it goes, so I don't know if they're going to pick up the other
0 A:  -- like most of the grocery stores.  
1 pack it all in the car and,
1 A:  and as we go places [laughter] we, oh, wait, we can drop the glass off
0 B:  Um.  
0 B:  -- but, uh, yeah,
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 like crunch the cans [laughter],
1 A:  Well, you get something [laughter].  
1 B:  Yeah, at first they said,   
1 Somehow that just seems weird to me [laughter].
0 use when a, uh, you get a, uh, a positive indication of drugs, but there's not
0 drug testing program, uh, well drug and alcohol [ringing] testing program.
0 A:  It's (( )).

0 spray it --
0 And they just got lucky because they didn't do anything to it, no fertilizing
0 A:  Well, that's, sometimes you have h-, cold winters, but we haven't had
0 B:  -- but, but at the same time, I don't think, uh, that should be governed

0 B:  What type, what type of business takes you to those climates or was that
0 modern versions into other languages.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Particularly if I'm going to be outdoors --

0 they would just shut off all the people that were marginal and, you know, it
0 B:  Yeah.  
1 B:  No, I don't think there is any such thing,
1 A:  Oh, my goodness.  
1 A:  Oh, boy.  
0 A:  I think, uh, you know, as any city grows up, uh, you get the hoods and the

0 we were able to take our dog with us, and he stayed with us and it was just

0 B:  Yeah, it's the same situation, really.  
0 B:  If I could solve problems, I'd be a rich person, but, guess I can't.  I'm

0 lot of areas, and, uh --
0 B:  -- because if you put in too much, and you, you don't use it all, you don't
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 thing they don't ha-, I guess I could say they really do need to, uh, uh, get

0 B:  -- but, uh, I, I carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all

0 A:  -- always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse.
1 they c-, they can't charge any more,

0 have excellent credit, why, it really does help.
0 you over the head.
0 B:  Yeah, even if it's five bucks, even.
0 B:  Yeah, exactly.
0 B:  Yeah, so.
0 B:  -- you know, what it comes in handy for when you're buying things like, um,

1 B:  I cannot think of the name.  I'm so bad with names of movies.
1 B:  Oh.
0 B:  I hear you.  Well, Leslie, there's, um, a ton,

0 you want to, uh, do this repair work.  And he told me almost two hundred and
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 thirty-five dollars or whatever they, they charge.  Maybe it's different, um,

1 B:  All the fun things, 
0 and like you say, those really make memories,
0 the kids, our kids were quite young and that's when this moose, great big
1 and, uh, it just kind of sauntered through,
0 A:  and went over to a stream and was eating and [lipsmack],
1 B:  #but# we, we figured we're getting a little too old to, 
1 B:  #that, uh, we# pulled behind the car and all the kids and the dog and,
1 B:  Yeah, it was and, uh, we, needless to say we ha-, we haven't done it again
1 B:   #And# since I moved to Dallas, I guess I haven't been as

0 A:  It's, oh, it's terrible.
0 A:  weekends, 
0 pollution is something individuals can work on as much as they can on some of

0 just have grown to expect it.  And, uh, [breathing] I don't mind, uh, helping
0 the face.
0 good things about it, but it was [breathing] one of the few things that we've
1 reestablish more normal relationships with us.  I don't know if that is in our
0 know, it can, history has shown that can just be a lull before the storm.
0 A:  Right [laughter].
0 B:  Carol.
0 B:  No, that's exaggeration.  But we had some problems yesterday so,
1 A:  Oh, no.
1 A:  I'm not sure what to do.
0 because we didn't paint when we first moved in.  And, uh, you know, when you
0 A:  And so there is just wear, wear and tear on the house.  But you don't
0 friends ha-, of ours had told us to go through.  And just things that they
0 might not normally look for.
0 beautiful.  And, and they had this big arrangement on the mantel.  And it, and
1 A:  #You know, their furniture.# Once you move in your furniture [laughter],
0 A:  Yeah.  Well, the only problem with these are that they are very expensive.
0 B:  I'm twenty-nine.
1 @B:  Well, and when I have my spare time [laughter],

0 B:  he might see it one day.
0 the soccer ball around or play throw the football and, uh, we also like to,
1 Texas --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
1 B:  No, I never did. 
1 myself, I had other interests I guess.  So [laughter].
1 recreation for me [laughter].
0 B:  No, I think we covered it pretty good.
0 then the eight one spring that, uh, where practically every lake in, uh, north,
0 it, uh, three or four years ago when we had the big ice storm?
0 have been with them, them for twenty three years, so and they are in the north
1 A:  Oh, okay.
1 was kind of like you.  I'm I didn't want to go back to Colorado because,
0 A:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Well, no, no, no, no,
1 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 B:  I know.  We, uh, we were, uh, over run by one in, uh [laughter].  We went
1 little chat about something, other than the weather,
1 B:  that's for sure.  Because I mean, he didn't look happy when we went by.
1 B:  advocating cold summers, no, no, no, no, no, no,
0 degree days hit, well it just couldn't couldn't handle the load and they, then
0 B:  Well, I am kind of confused about American made products because Ford and
0 B:  Yes, I did [static].
0 B:  I bought a Chrysler New Yorker and my daughter bought a Plymouth Sundance.
0 B:  #No.#
0 and I thought that was totally American.  And, uh, that is why I stayed away
1 American made and Japanese and [inhaling] I am not sure which is the best.

0 A:  Uh, Dale Co-, Dale Corporation.  I'm not,
1 A:  Uh, I, I don't know, ma'am.

1 loaders on the government,
0 B:  Yeah.
1 of the,
1 A:  I think that's a really good point.
1 B:  Yeah.
1 dare say that we'll probably still using, still be using,

0 more parenting and I am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it.
0 bit.
0 because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what
1 A:  Yeah.  I somehow can't do that I, 
1 you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home
1 A:  Okay, I have never done this before so [laughter].
0 problem is, uh, parents and, uh, their lack I guess of, uh, interest in the
0 B:  Oh, yeah.
0 A:  Yeah.  That's definitely, true.
0 B:  -- uh, some people you know, uh, just really clam up when it comes to a
0 test and they are so nervous about well is there, is this a trick question --
0 problems like in general in the world, like with gangs or such just being
0 uh, a little more educated in it or forced into using it more.
1 to the tip of his finger, or, you know.
1 B:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 
0 A:  I have an older son, yeah.  He doesn't have any children yet though.

0 B:  #Oh, was it?#  [laughter].
0 A:  -- but I know it's not a thoroughbred, but it, it, and we
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 A:  Um.
1 and the paint and everything.  He finally just had to redo the whole ceiling
1 A:  Huh.
0 A:  Well,
0 B:  -- during the day and then I would just have to come home and call him at

0 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].
0 and we put new linoleum and then we had the ceiling fixed and put a new floor

1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 A:  Yeah.

0 A:  You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:   #That's, that's the part that,# 
1 B:  #t-, d-, whether my dentist or# [laughter],
0 A:  It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have

0 B:  #I'm in office.# 
0 A:  #Yeah.#  
1 A:  Oh, yeah.  
0 B:  #more to the# point.  If you knew what you were getting when you voted, uh,

0 B:  #Well, you're much younger.# 
1 A:  Well, I'm not actually.  I just started my family younger [laughter].

0 A:  -- that's another problem.  
0 producing unit.  Uh, there are other, you know, things that, that may, I mean,
0 look at that, I was talking to my father the other day about the N A S A

0 A:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
0 for me than for, let's say, my colleagues who are a lot older, 
0 A:   I think it's changed.  I think that in the last twenty or

0 B:  That's great.
0 B:  Oh, well, he probably showed you all the tricks --
1 A:  -- and I fixed it.

1 A:  [Laughter] It's probably why we're participating, too, right.
0 actually how we do it is my husband and I both work, and we try very hard to
0 live on his salary, and my salary goes automatically into a savings account,
0 A:  [Music] {piano} Um, the cost of living here is cheap.  In, in fact, it's
1 hooked up with this, uh,
0 A:  #Well, that's good.#
0 B:  -- or maybe, I don't know.  Ours is nice, our home is nicely located, but I
1 computer program, in fact I'm an accountant, I'm a C P A,
1 B:  -- um, and I did it for three years and hated every minute of it
1 daughter wants to know where the spaghetti cheese is [laughter],
1 and that's another thing too, she really enjoys it.  She, uh, uh --
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  How did you get on this list?

1 B:  -- and the fact that they let parents or, or people file lawsuits.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah --
0 B:  -- because then, you know, their minds are made up as to what they're going
0 A:  That's right, #but again# --
1 talking about,
1 them.
0 B:  Uh, I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because I do

1 A:  Yeah, I think it's a lot colder than it does in Dallas,
0 out clothes.  Like if someone were to buy me an outfit --
1 A:  -- and put out with it, I would wear it all the time,
1 A:  but as far as me picking out clothes myself, oh, it's not very good

1 @A:  Yeah, uh, well, I think some places like, not necessarily at McDonald's,
1 B:  our own defense system doesn't do it.  
1 manager all the way down,
0 B:  You know, like you said, not at McDonald's, but, you know, there's nothing
1 at McDonald's except a deep fat fryer full of grease that --
0 B:  Well, that's good, you know, I, it prevents a lot, it's a great deterrent.
1 B:   Yeah.  
0 B:   -- but that's okay.  
1 B:   Well, isn't that the tr- [laughter].  
0 B:   It's three times a week and, it just, the minute you get off
1 shape before we went so that I wouldn't just fall over dead
1 quitting.  
1 because -- 
1 A:   -- for one of them, so, uh, that's why I say I can't quite --

0 B:   Well, really.  
1 child}.  
0 A:  Okay, you ready for me to push one?  
0 B:  Especially now that all the, you know, everybody is getting older and
1 last one because comfort is not [laughter],
1 A:  -- and I was a little nervous about some new technology [laughter].
1 anything that looked like service department at a dealership [laughter].
0 you think?
1 A:  Yeah, that's interesting because, I mean, I, I was hearing, just o-,
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 not in Decembe, but [laughter],
0 A:  Yeah.  
1 A:  Well, good [laughter].  
0 A:  But we really don't have a monthly budget that we live on, but we don't
0 quite a change in our [lipsmack] income because I'm --
0 A:  We both have done that.  Uh, we both work at companies that have credit
1 B:  -- budgeting.  
0 A:  Good [laughter].  Smart budgeting?  Is that what you said, or just smart,
0 is probably a lot more liquid than C Ds or, or, uh, Money, Money Markets.  I
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 Celica.
0 A:  For sure.  
0 B:  -- just can't afford that.

0 B:  Oh, yeah, well, that's the way mothers are [laughter].  
1 B:  Okay [laughter].  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  So, uh,
0 B:  Oh, really?  
0 B:  We've always bought American made cars, mostly Oldsmobiles.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  So,   
1 A:  -- and, uh, it's pretty well driven me crazy [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, was it, oh.
0 A:  That's true.  Sometimes they,
0 A:  Oh, my goodness [laughter].
0 B:  -- for the older, you know, the fours and the --
0 B:  -- three year olds and stuff.  So that's, that is really good.  I really
0 like that.
0 A:  That would be fun, yeah.  That's good for the kids and then it's fun for
0 B:  -- and, um, I don't, I think, I think you start out like with say twenty or
0 B:  -- and then it can be pretty informative also.
1 B:  You know, what for him to finish me off [laughter].
0 philosophy --
1 A:  Um, I was much too young, I was born in sixty-seven, so.
0 B:  Downside.  Um, uh, well, the (( )) says we should, uh, go into the grief

0 [laughter] You remember that?
1 well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo.
1 and say, well let's get to the point and.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 things.  You know, in America it seems now, it's independence is the thing,
0 B:  -- whereas we used to be able to depend on each other and trust each other
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 California.  Not all that much, but, um, enough to get a little flavor for it.
0 A:  Well, you know, this is really funny, because I've tried to make these
0 B:  -- and it's also cleaner, because you can go swimming every day, and #it's
1 experience, it sounds like.
0 @B:  [Laughter] Well, I've got two kids.  One of them's a year old and one of
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- it's really hard to find child care around here because most people that

0 A:  Because they're, they're real young.
0 cartoon --
1 and I,
1 A:  Right.
0 I will need to go back to work, and so I'm looking at this issue, and my four

0 --
0 A:  -- unless they get volunteers who have, people who have trucks and that
0 --
0 B:  Yeah.  They have that in Houston and in Dallas, and I saw another report

1 deposit, I know that if you discard anything, somebody will pick up,
0 to separate the cans from all the rest of the trash.  Yeah.
0 A:  Yeah, yeah, that seems like it would be, you know, very labor intensive to
0 B:  Um, now soft drink companies don't want that because it, uh, obviously, it
0 B:  It should be, anyway.  Well, did you see, there was an interesting article
1 B:  -- that talked about some commodities that are being recycled.  Uh, they
0 [laughter], they, they just finished out recycling before there's an industry
0 a bunch of it, because it was just piling up and they had no where to put it.
0 B:  I, I don't know how much sensitive things like soft drinks sales are to
1 B:  If I could get rid of that [laughter],

0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah, right, right.  
0 breath, and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.  That'd be just as
0 B:  Yeah.  Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and

0 A:  What kind of, what's their relationship like?
0 B:  Uh.
1 A:  Yeah.  Uh, but they were pretty close, at least compared to me and my
1 A:  Um, uh, do you plan to have more children?
1 B:  No [laughter].
1 @B:  [Laughter]  I walk.
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 screwed the tension all the way up so you can hardly move.
0 like it was doing much #except maybe for my arms.#
0 B:  -- and, uh, walking is repeatable --
1 B:  Is that right?  So you get, uh, so you get more exercise than.
0 B:  Yes, uh-huh.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 and [inhaling] there was one man here that had forty-two D W I -s --

0 you think or,
0 B:  Uh, yes, it is.  The benefits plan is different for operating, for what we

0 B:  Yeah.
0 home.
0 B:  That seems to be, uh.
0 B:  Yeah, it, uh, it takes a lot of patience.
1 B:  And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time.
0 A:  Right.  Because it's support people that are #providing# --
0 quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts.
0 A:  #Right, okay.#                  
0 B:  No, we don't.  My husband, uh, takes care of our finances and he just, uh,
0 use a computer, because you just can't keep track of everything manually.

1 easier.
1 apply that to another one, I try to do that, but it's not always,

1 A:  oh wow.  We do everything else fast [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  #Yeah,# yeah, my, uh, my grandmother is, hers is physically she is in not

0 B:  Yeah.
1 B:  #One# for your garbage and then [swallowing] #I have no room.#
1 A:  And th-, well, at least, maybe it keeps someone from stealing, you know.

0 A:  Interesting.
0 A:  Sure.
0 Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student, but the best private

0 B:  -- but it's just you know [laughter],
0 A:  Uh, there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few
0 B:  Right.  Huh.
0 B:  Right, yeah.
0 B:  Right, huh.
1 investigative reports, you know, is you're kids bus driver smoking crack,
1 A:  Yeah, farm report and oil reports.
0 A:  -- you know got really hurt and everything.
1 pile and that's not easy either.  I wish I could figure out an easier way.
0 know cardboard packaging stuff left over then I go and I recycle that over
0 B:  -- and to define recycle paper as paper that includes, you know, material
1 A:  One rotten cat [laughter].
1 B:  Yeah, that's the boys. [laughter] They know I don't like it.
1 like what are doing.
1 know spent the most time with him.
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  So that, is that, is that kind of your child right now?
0 A:  Uh, my brother has.  Uh, we didn't do a lot with them.  Uh, I never felt
0 handle, so he was just tied up to a post --
1 A:  I don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that though
0 certain, they had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with
0 year a different piece of the city gets added to the list, but in my
0 while they were, the newspapers, there were places, but I think they had so
0 and a site that wasn't geologically proper.
0 communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away, but
0 been a Goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car --
0 B:  -- and they have pretty economical rates, but now in South Carolina there
1 for.
1 B:  Right.
1 the idea.  They were surely thinking a lot harder than I can think [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, it is.  That's, that's one of the things.  That's the reason why they
0 not going to be, I mean if they haven't formed some sort of an opinion, I, uh,
0 their life and don't hear about anything --
1 A:  #Right.# I mean you want people who are engaged [laughter].
0 B:  Right.
0 you can, uh, prevent that.
0 almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if
0 A:  Uh, in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon.
1 A:  Uh, yeah, I'd probably, I'd probably say about a five.
1 B:  [Laughter]  That's where I would probably be [laughter].
0 B:  Well, I mean, I mean I don't really know what they can, how they can really
0 B:  #Yeah.#
0 B:  Well, is the crime that bad there in Atlanta?
0 like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years.
0 B:  I don't know if Dallas is in the top three --
1 they're going to shoot through five wall,
0 you know a real good defensive weapon.  You can sort of point it somewhere in
0 A:  Um.
0 they, they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper --
0 B:  -- uh, I've you know either computer paper or different types of paper.
0 B:  So,
0 B:  Um.
0 that, but that's kind of what I want to set up so.  Because we do go through
0 our money apparently.  The, uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much to
0 but #I basically,# 
0 A:  Right, I don't need to.  [laughter] I am the only that I have to keep track

0 B:  So, it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start
1 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  [Laughter] You know, which means at the moment, paying off the VISA bill
1 wise but, uh, the other side of it is, so, not much on that side of it
1 B:  Yeah, we'd like to do that some day.
0 A:  Yeah.
0 then we come back for a year.  We go over four, we come back for a year.
0 B:  #So.#
0 A:  -- I, uh, I know who they are.  They, uh, [inhaling] they have an office,
0 uh, in in Costa Mesa as I recall.
0 and assesses the need.
0 cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as
1 speaking any French [laughter].
1 A:  [Laughter] [breathing].
0 things I always considered was real important about job benefits, I always,
0 worked forty hours a week.  So the, uh, it works out that if I have to go in
0 eyebrow, but because of that I'm not a clock watcher.  [throat_clearing] If I,
1 that you are also a professional [laughter] salaried employee [laughter].
0 A:  Right [laughter].
1 A:  [Noise] Wow [laughter].
1 A:  -- I suppose I had longer to think about it #so,#
1 A:  -- and I, I when I ride the bik-, when I ride my bike to campus, I
1 locality, I think it was Portland, ended up burning,
0 @A:  Well, I mean, in D C there's a law that was recently passed that like, uh,
1 doesn't want their landfills closed and sued,
0 A:  No, not really.  I mean,
0 more receptacles, uh, around on the streets even would, would, uh, make people
0 do it.  If it's there, they are going to do it.  Still, I mean, some people
0 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  Of course, you are on a college campus --
0 B:  Now that's really tough.  Because you read stuff and you can't tell whether
1 if you have this cup,
1 it out once and a while and then reuse it.
1 B:  Yeah, like, imagine that?  [laughter].
0 A:  That's true.  Yeah.
0 A:  But I think nursing homes can be good.  It just depends on what kind they
0 are.  You know, you need to check them out ahead of time.
0 [noise].
0 A:  [Smack] Yeah, that they're [noise],
0 B:  Gives her a little bit of her own independence --
0 A:  Okay, so I just press one then right?
0 A:  -- and [smack] forty hours is just too long.  You just don't have any time
0 A:  And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday, okay.  And that
0 A:  It, it, that's, that's a possibility.
0 B:  -- uh, I, my job has most of the benefits I want.  Uh, what I really like
0 for continuing education.  Like, I, I get night courses that they they'll
0 cover right now and that's really good ((yeah)).
0 that you're categorized.  Some people can be let go and replaced like, uh, say,
1 B:  So, uh, what are your camping experiences like?  
1 A:  -- and [laughter] that's part of, my camping experience is,
1 that it didn't act-, cover everyone,
1 couldn't stay too long, but we drove on that morning to, uh, Las Vegas, so
1 he said he'd lived on a farm too long and that was too much like camping
1 anyway #[laughter].#
1 B:  They're getting started early this year, I'll tell you that much.  The,
0 A:  -- and making them earn their -- 
0 people ought to be made to pay for their stay --
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- because that wouldn't be, uh, putting anybody to death forcibly, but,
1 B:  And, the benefits that I get are very minimal.  
0 A:  Yeah [laughter].  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  S-, but, not any real significant benefits.  
0 A:  Right.  
1 B:  My health insurance is very minimal.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 We don't have health insurance or paid vacation and,
0 A:   ((Uh-huh)).
0 B:  Usually academic jobs you get T I A A for your retirement plan --
0 A:  Oh, [breathing] I'm, I'm just not entirely sure.  I have only been working
0 B:  -- and, uh, you know, it, it's a, I think it's a mistake to move large
0 the, uh, fuel cracking towers and chemical plants.
1 B:  Actually very,
0 A:  Right.  
0 once a year.
0 A:  Yeah, I guess right now what they're, what they're primarily worried about
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 been using is, that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes
0 A:  So it's kind of an interesting situation.  It's not [laughter], not a real
0 B:  Well, you also have the very close related thing of the, uh, rain forest
0 uh, major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the --
0 A:  [Ringing].
0 A:  [Ringing].
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 B:  Well, I think we pay it in other ways.  
1 ===========================================================================
0 so much that you ought to take this other guy's life for it.  I think you can
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  So, uh, I just, I, I'm just basically against it.  
1 bloopers in there once in a while.
1 actually I'm, I'm in favor of it, uh [laughter],
1 punishment, which I'm also against.
1 A:  And so, so, I'm sort of in this quandary, you know, I mean, either you have
1 [laughter], 
1 A:  So, so you kind of get into this hotel phenomenon, you know, where you,
0 western people's concept of c-, civilization, you know.
1 you know,
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 his di-, I, there's a million, there's a million things,
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 have any recycling.  We don't even have a bottle bill or anything like that
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  #Yeah [laughter].#  
0 A:  That's where it's like every, ev-, every, every can is stamped with like a,
0 like distributor to distributor --
0 that, like, just can't be reused.
0 know, when you're buying, everything is, you know, if it's not convenient,
0 there's a threat that, that they might get caught, it might be that much more
0 A:  Well, I mean, I would think that, uh, if someone knows that there's,
0 A:  Good point, it's a good point and, although, although alcohol consumption
0 A:  Yeah, okay, so we're started.  
0 uh, this requires a very strong minded management and, uh, uh, a supervisory,
0 [throat_clearing] you've got to take a drug test.
1 B:  No.  
0 A:  -- uh, rather than to improve their productivity by stamping out drug use
0 A:  Oh, okay.  
1 and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  -- which, in Atlanta is nothing.  
1 is because we're sort of on the outskirts of this rather plush area so
1 something.
0 B:  Okay.  
0 B:  I think it was mandatory in the state, but they did it, and they started a
0 here and we'd asked at three different places and nobody recycles.
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- they have really good benefits.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Oh, okay, so that's real simple.  
1 B:  Yeah, yeah, they have, they, uh, it does [laughter].  
0 B:  Do, do you work where you have benefits like that?  
0 A:  Yeah, it's nice.  
0 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  -- for the, uh, actually if you're, I believe, I, I read up on some of it,
0 A:  Or is that,
1 A:  Yeah, I take away a, uh, addiction [laughter].  
0 A:  -- uh, I mean, they, they say it's like the sixth grade reading level, but
1 A:  -- I swear it's at least second or third grade,
0 at the, the Smith trial.
0 A:  Oh, really?  That's kind of boring to me, I think.  
1 A:  Okay supposedly we're recording right now.  
0 coolants.

0 B:  And so, to be honest with you, I've [breathing], I've, uh, I don't think
1 A:  You'll,

0 A:  I'm sure it is, yeah.  
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  You know, because, you know, because, uh, the country's going to wind up
0 A:  I think a lot of it was, was just that, you know, becau-, because of, of
0 B:  Uh.  
1 B:  Boy, that's a good one.

0 B:  Yeah so,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  How old is, uh, how old is the truck?

0 B:  Um.  
1 B:  Um.  
0 priced them and kind of felt like it would be just as cheap for us to go on

1 A:  Okay [laughter].  
1 walk by the newspaper stand,
1 look at it for a minute, then walk into my office.
1 I, probably about one of the least informed people [laughter],
0 at the front page.  Uh, I also used to listen to, uh, [lip_smack] public

0 A:  -- and things.  
1 Japanese or the, if I like them enough to purchase one.
1 of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better,

1 B:  -- as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, Munich, it's kind of

1 we'll, uh, we'll let you have the rest of the week for free [laughter].
1 B:  But I say, well, heck with it, we'll go buy it from that guy on the street
1 A:  there's nothing else I can do,
1 A:  -- and you can run, and you can run the, uh, the ticker across the bottom,
1 preconceptions about cats.
0 A:  Well, it was very, it was interesting because it, it's just, you know, part
1 A:  And, uh,
1 actually thinks it's a cat,
1 A:  -- sometimes I think, wow, if I had two cats, I'd just, you know, get a
1 B:  I'm,
1 B:  you know, now it, it's pretty self sufficient.  I just think,
1 B:  -- and I think that that's pretty much,
1 we were never broken into and th-, but the people on either side of us were
1 B:  Uh, we, we usually had rifle cleaning parties on the front porch when, you
1 B:  have all your friends over, play the Grateful Dead and clean your rifles --
1 A:  Yeah, yeah.

1 A:  Uh, she's a, around fifty pounds.  She's a, a very, very skinny shepherd

1 of K Mart service, or, uh, well, K Mart's not all that bad.
1 A:  Beats me, uh, yeah, in Massachusetts, it's the judicial system.
1 A:  They're buildings are all falling down [laughter].  
0 B:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.  
0 B:  -- it's, you know, that goes back to a drug problem -- 
0 B:  -- the family unit's caused a lot of the problems.  I mean the dad is gone
0 B:  It, I think the whole thing just needs a complete overhaul, but it starts
0 A:  -- against women and, uh, the drug wars and, uh, also, uh, let's see, I
0 A:  And, uh, I, there's a lot of complications that go along with saying that.

0 A:  But I,
0 A:  Don't know.  
1 A:  But, maybe not, maybe not.  I could be confused.  What do I know
1 [laughter]?
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 moral and some are, uh, [lipsmack] more logistical as to the merits of
1 B:  Well, that's, I think you can take that nice simple, nice simple
0 [laughter], nice problematical logistical argument and say, well, are you
0 be pretty well ignored these days.  [inhaling] Uh [breathing],
1 B:  So, what are they doing down in, uh, Georgia?  
0 A:  Murders, big murders.  
1 that we need more or anything like that.
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 eventually, uh, like Klaus Von Bulow
1 comes our turn to retire, the money will be there for us.
0 B:  Yes, uh,
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  -- passing the line item veto.  
1 A:  Yeah.

1 doesn't have too much of a message, too much to say.
0 A:  Uh-huh [laughter].  
0 but as far as, yeah, I don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often
1 B:  Okay.  
1 @B:  Well, how about those Redskins, huh.   
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  they compete pretty vigorously for all the Redskins cards. 
1 B:  -- is just a, guy's a monster.
1 B:  I mean not, inhuman.  
0 A:  And two hundred and some pounds [laughter].  
0 A:  But, uh, he's one of the taller ones.  
1 C next year?
0 B:  You think Denver will be as tough as they were this year?  
1 B:  Cornhuskers, right [laughter].  
0 A:  ((Uh, now I get)) Sunday and Monday n-, Sunday afternoon and Monday nights
1 are reserved for me.
1 B:  Oh [laughter].  
1 I could actually watch some football.
1 A:  [Laughter]. 
0 replays they did they were over the two minute limit and stuff this last year
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.  
0 B:  -- that type, not much home break ins.  There are some, but not, not very
0 double assault there.
0 B:  Really?  
1 A:  Now, there's a crime for you.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 B:  -- so you really not making a sizeable profit.  So it's not really
1 and, uh, the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 B:  -- uh, but, I guess, uh, that would take a major constitutional change here
0 A:  So they get to make the decision -- 
0 B:  Exactly.  
1 A:  Are, are you willing to take off from work and lose a day's pay?
0 A:  So, Cathy, uh, do you keep a monthly budget?
1 B:  You can hear him, and the one is four and he's off taking a bath
1 B:  No, no, no -- 
0 A:  previous nine years or so, we've just pretty much let it slide, uh, there
0 A:  #Interesting.#  
0 works reasonable well.  So, i-, most of my friends though, when they find out
1 about it, they, th-, they think, your husband submits a bill to you that's,
1 ten years old next month so,
0 carrying anybody to, you know, rather than have them stoop down to get over,
0 A:  -- I think the four door is probably a major requirement and, other than
1 it's so bad that I need a four wheel drive, I probably ought to be home
0 B:  Actually, uh, pretty good way of looking at it, yeah.  We, uh, we had a
0 A:  Wow.  
0 B:  -- a few years ago.  A case where there was a, sort of freak ice storm and
1 A:  Such as New York City [laughter]?
0 really, I mean it is a crime,
1 you count all the little things that people do like, uh, speeding is a crime
0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Yeah, it does and, and it decreases the prison population.  
0 A:  And, which is -- 
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  -- and, and if another alternative was --
0 A:  Right.  
1 B:  -- to society that aren't in prison.  
1 A:  [Laughter] Right, probably more of them then the other way around
0 punishment we have here.
1 A:  Really?  
0 they have K C R W, which I, I, I saw a thing recently, they may be trying to
1 B:  -- and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one,
1 A:  Yeah, they're thick.  
0 then, and in detail.  Uh, they, uh, we, we used to have two papers here in
1 A:  Yeah, that's, that's kind of a problem for them.  There's a lot of people
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 when the TIMES found out there was a place called Orange County [laughter].
0 uh, feeling of, of responsibility, ownership --
1 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 B:  Well, the, uh, unfortunate truth is that no matter what sort of a program
0 or whatever that, gets put out there and made available by the taxpayers'
0 B:  And, oh, doing a public service.  
0 it kind of, uh, freezes itself up.  You very seldom a-, a-, a-, able to do

1 A:  Well, I'm a student, that's why I was asking.

0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 richy part, I guess.  I'm not,
1 A:  You know.  Uh, but, you know, I'm happy with what they're in, so, go ahead

0 A:  You know, uh, that has a, a whole lot to do with it, you know, as far as

0 B:  Well, I've had several different kinds of day-care.
0 A:  Uh-huh.

0 B:  Oh, no.
0 @A:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

1 B:  N-, Nebraska [laughter].  Yeah there's a running team.  
1 reality, it's really Americans playing somewhere else #[laughter] you know
0 B:  #Yeah?#
1 element of stupidity in there somewhere #[laughter].#
1 thing.
0 B:  #So, yeah,# I could see the feel for that.  But it's, it's pretty, it's fun
0 A:  Yeah.
0 A:  -- least not in this country anyway.
0 A:  To tell you the truth, I'm not even really from here.  
0 B:  Like the Seahawks [laughter].
1 A:  Well, you know, I [laughter].
1 love for Miami [laughter] anyway.
0 B:  I agree with you there.  
0 A:  Well, that's easy.  Whenever you donate money to someone?
0 makes me mad is, uh, then they start getting, uh, other people, th-, the
0 A:  -- who is soliciting should know at all.  Just, uh, and that was very
0 A:  Right [/T V].
0 him a lot.
0 B:  -- and, for, for, I'm sure, a lot of people going into a nursing home it's
1 {in background}.  But they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents

0 they need.  Uh,

1 B:  Right.  #Okay.#
0 B:  #Yeah.#
1 A:  #So, I've# actually, probably making less money than I was when I started
0 B:  E-, exercising, uh, I play w-, uh, wally ball.  Are you familiar with that?
1 since we play before work.
1 extent of my exercise [laughter].  It's kind of crazy.
0 but we have a, a fitness center at, there at the building.

1 A:  #No,# no.  This is low impact.  This is safe stuff [laughter].
1 A:  -- get pretty strenuous #[laughter] doing that sort of stuff.#
0 how# --
0 A:  Like the class I'm in now does not do jumping jacks.  
1 ready to go home and eat dinner #[laughter].#
1 I'm like ugh #[laughter].#
1 A:  Well the advantage is sometimes I'm too tired to eat #[laughter].#
0 B:  No.  No.  This is documentary, uh, it was a, a, you know, released in

0 little bit less a year in North Carolina #now.  I# --
0 A:  #Uh-huh.#
0 sure that they don't have capital punishments.  #Wis-, Wisconsin# --
0 in, uh, the jury process and I suppose an elitist might say, well, you really
0 a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever, but I
0 A:  Um.  
0 A:  I've heard that some of the information, uh, is prevented from reaching the
0 B:  I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are.
0 years and --
0 B:  Is that right?  Yeah.  
1 B:  Yeah, I've got one little girl and, and, and a set of golf clubs, so
1 summer car [laughter], you know.
0 you know, to get nasty, the Starion goes, like into the, into the garage --
1 B:  Uh-huh [laughter].  
1 know, this r-, Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde,
0 experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent
0 A:  [Lipsmack] I, I'll agree it, it's not your responsibility but, b-, is it
0 B:  Right.  But the point is is that businesses do that.  The business that you
0 to a #consumer and# --
0 chaos and regular deterioration.  So I don't, not having seen anything to,
0 only and I was lucky because I don't think I would have graduated at all, I

0 They treated him like, uh, he was one of the kids.  You know, they had their

1 any extra money for anything, he spent it.
1 A:  Well, I'm, #I'm saving.#
0 A:  And my ex made, uh, under forty.
0 B:  Yeah.  Well I think that one thing that people don't do a lot of these
0 B:  Oh, uh-huh.
0 A:  And they just, they ended up, a lot of them ended up owing more at the
0 A:  Oh, [sigh] we put, uh, vitamins in the water.  And, uh, we don't take
0 A:  Well, the, I think the important thing, uh, we've had several dogs and,

1 A:  Yeah #[laughter].#  
0 B:  #Uh.#
0 technologically based as far as our industry in the city here.  But we do have
0 the same problem a lot of ar-, other areas up here in the northeast have and
0 here in New York state are going after right now is, it's, it's the, uh,
0 ongoing acid rain problem.  Especially out in the, uh, uh, Adirondack areas
1 right.  Our most pollute substance down here is just water.  But I 
1 B:  Right.
0 the air pollution and that and help but if you have nowhere to do anything.

0 B:  -- you know [laughter].  
0 B:  Or something like that, yeah.
1 B:  -- and then I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system,

1 B:  Yeah.  It, it hits me as the Orwell thing.  Big brother is watching
1 A:  Yeah.
0 B:  [Laughter] That type of deal and I sh-, I don't really, you know, I don't
0 sending two thousand dollars that way every year, you, uh, watch what goes on
0 A:  And, uh, uh, I also think that one of the problems and, actually, I don't
0 education is really, uh, really a problem with the culture.  And, I guess my
1 particular purse strings rather than the public good and by definition,
0 the, uh, uh, now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is,
1 B:  kids too?
0 B:  #Oh, you laugh.#  How many, what ages?  [laughter].
1 A:  Oh, yeah.
1 B:  What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest?
0 B:  -- I do stuff with my kids, you know.  
0 A:  Right.  Well, you know, with kids you're not going to have a neat house.
1 B:  Well, I've accepted that too [laughter].
0 that where they're not really missing the presence, you know.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 B:  #Absolutely.  Yeah [laughter].#
0 B:  And what would you do, what?
0 A:  -- and, you know, the younger kids, uh, or maybe all of them needed help at
1 little bit,
0 A:  #And we just have this,# uh, really good time there.  One thing is they

1 wants to deal with bugs and, uh --
1 B:  [Laughter] Right [laughter].
1 B:  Uh, there was certainly nothing like a, a bathroom, a shower or anything,
0 supposed to be patrolled but, uh, you know, it's, it's a little bit different.
1 B:  Yeah.  I mean, it's to easy to get a quorum --
1 B:  -- and simple majority won't do.  
1 A:  [Laughter] No.  And even like, you know, two-thirds majority, I mean, it's
0 B:  And there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be
1 playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know.
1 A:  Yeah.  ((Like)) Gives them a little too much power [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].  Tha-, I, I know of a couple of people at least who would

1 Louisiana.
0 A:  Yeah, I haven't either other than,

0 @B:  Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes.
