0 A:  Uh-huh. 
1 B:  I don't know.  Send them over to Iraq [laughter]. 
1 B:  Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and
0 A:  Huh-uh. 
0 and you know,
0 ==========================================================================
0 computerized conversation that there's little children, you know, bouncing in

0 A:  #I just haven't# had much opportunity to do it lately.
0 A:  It's, it's a pretty big and we put that over rice.
1 B:  You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens [laughter].

0 B:  All right, thank you, bye-bye.
0 you can get out on the water, that's the main thing.

1 B:  Bob ((Macky)) and such [laughter].
0 B:  All right.
0 A:  Right.
0 a lot of things but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can, uh,
0 tested,
1 A:  Yeah, I'm sure it is. 
0 not just the government's responsibility anymore.  You can't just blame it on
1 pursuit.  It's like this train.
0 uh, going, I guess.
0 A:  You bet, especially in the South.
1 B:  Okay, well, go ahead, I'll let you start.
0 farming, or, or something like that, so you're really learning a skill [/TV].
0 All the ones that are already retired.  So what we could do is take all the

1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Yeah.  
0 you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's, uh, you know, somebody
0 B:  Right.

0 A:  -- or THE ACCUSED. 
0 B:  Uh, I, I don't have a, other than, than a reading and, and male perspective
1 A:  You know.  We just got our phone back today, uh,
1 punishment, but if I were sitting on a jury and had to make the decision
1 should keep them waiting in jail and let, having us pay for it for twenty

1 A:  there's even less interest there.  They're more for, I g-,

1 B:  Yeah, I knew you weren't the Tar Heels.  
1 was there three years, or four years, rather, and never missed them.
0 A:  They give you shirts, right which --
0 about it, uh-huh.
0 @B:  Oh, if I knew that I'd be a very wealthy person.
0 A:  We are lucky enough to now be on a cable system that has four public T V
1 A:  You know, I just, I'm just shocked at the end of the month,
0 A:  to see what damage I have did, but [laughter],
1 A:  I'll eat the dark meat, but you can have the white meat.
0 right now, though, Kentucky's just now getting off of a, uh, their suspension
0 B:  Yeah.
1 A:  I know it, I know it [laughter].
1 think they have to do that because most everybody passes.

1 B:  -- because it's right by their entryway.  And they, they wanted roses.  So
0 A:  My, um, husband's father has a place out in East Texas so he's always
0 A:  #Oh well, that's good to know.#

1 A:  They like that.  
0 B:  -- that when you get something you're lucky to get it, so to speak --
0 I feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that, with a [laughter]

0 B:  No, I think it's supposed to be natural.
0 B:  Um, she, she breaks both of his ankles.
0 just a movie, but no, Mama, I've seen it [laughter].

0 A:  #So it's good talking to you.#
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 A:  And, they just, they ruin, [laughter],
1 B:  You know, yeah, I don't know if it would be dishonest or honest though
1 A:  Yeah, I would imagine women would understand maternity a lot better than
1 the feminists,
0 you know, his, you know, and that never has offended me when, you know, when
0 A:  I think I'm more scared of her not because she's a female but bec-, more
0 everybody here at school has to buy one.
0 fortunate that it worked out that way.  Uh, another, uh, calamity, I guess,
1 [laughter], maybe I'd have looked over there.
0 they're just like, you know, someone from the country lost in the big city, I

1 legal assistant and that's what I know, so, and, uh, just nothing basically

1 A:  And I think, why didn't you tell me a year ago when we got the other dog
0 A:  Oh my goodness.
1 B:  So first thing I think of is how easy would this,
0 B:  Um.
1 A:  There's yeah, there's a few designs I guess I've done myself, but not very
0 fact I had a bunch of people come to look at it, and they were fighting over
1 me a shopping list of things I needed to get done [laughter].

0 one, and --
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  -- that they have a homing instinct.
0 people to invade your privacy when they want to, I think it's, um,
0 B:  -- and by the time you come back --
0 B:  You know, because, you know, you, you learn who the leaders are, and, you
0 B:  Probably not.  Uh, we already knew we wanted to take one, and we just
0 A:  Uh-huh, yeah.
0 other than their present salary?
0 B:  -- and one that has good staff, that, uh, you know, will take care of you

0 know.
0 B:  [Laughter].
1 A:  No way.
0 A:  And, uh, uh, some things we like to do together with our family are, um, in
1 picnic and, and go to every park from Northern Utah to Southern Utah
0 B:  So the mountains would take a while to get around to, to find any.
0 B:  There are some, as a matter of fact --
1 B:  [Laughter].
1 year old last year for Christmas, we rented,

0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  It's, it's been really good.  We've, um, we're on a, a monthly budget and
1 it would take, it would probably take the whole news hour [laughter].
0 B:  #But, uh.#
0 A:  Yeah.
0 boring.
0 A:  Um, yeah, it's, it's pretty, pretty expensive on the outside.
0 A:  -- yeah --
0 A:  Oh.
0 is really listen to what they say, because, and that's another hard thing, uh,
0 A:  Right.
0 A:  That's fun.
0 B:  Yeah, that's right, right.  [laughter] Um, well, I'm down, [laughter] I

0 B:  Right.
0 thinking of, uh, starting up a little preschool --
1 A:  It's tough.
0 taxes are higher than ours, so I guess I shouldn't be, I shouldn't complain so
0 B:  Um, [throat_clearing] it takes so long with, uh, the appeals process, uh,
0 B:  Yeah.
0 A:  But, we try to put a little away ever-, every month you know and plus we've
0 too bad of shape.  She is in her upper eighties, I guess, forgetting in my
1 B:  I don't know what it is.
0 using them again so that I don't keep doing that.  But, boy, I mean, it's an
1 them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent.  It was rid-, you know,
0 fairly low.
1 A:  Just, you just pay it, huh [laughter].
1 B:  -- and it's not the safest neighborhood there is.
0 B:  -- and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen, Texas not too
0 just like released from a mental hospital the day before.  You know, be, be
0 B:  Uh, but,
0 A:  That's right.  [laughter] Yeah, mine's, uh, seven years old and I think
0 A:  So, uh, yeah.  You guys [child_talking], uh, do you get much of a chance to

0 somebody else's life and because that is so very wrong, we are going to take
0 B:  Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and, you know, I'm going,
0 here, and you do get a good bit of, uh, smog and stuff, especially from all
0 B:  Oh, e-, even where you do have the inspections, you know, the inspection is
0 B:  You know, so that, that's why I just don't, uh, there's a lot of, you know,
1 A:  [Ringing].
0 A:  -- you have a company and you're trying to, you're trying to stay afloat
0 A:  Uh, we have a couple of collection places around, but they're pretty
0 B:  Right.  
0 A:  -- and also what they can be told about the effects of sentencing.  Like,
1 A:  Yeah, so, I have an exercise bike at home, but I don't use it [laughter].
0 B:  And in a very poor section of town with p-, predominantly Anglo kids.  And
0 A:  Crimes of that nature, I think should definitely, any mass murderer type
0 finished off a room upstairs [breathing], but that was a [breathing], that
0 A:  Yeah, and it's almost as though, that was, stuff was more available to T V
0 much higher on the radio, although --
0 A:  [Laughter] Oh, of course, of course they are.  They want you to buy their

0 B:  Uh-huh.  
1 all the other dogs [laughter].
0 A:  Oh, that's nice.  
0 B:  But, other than that, uh, I haven't had too much, too much problem with the

1 that?
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
1 B:  Yeah.  
0 B:  Yeah.

0 B:  Uh-huh.  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  [Breathing] So it's, uh, I think they call it car jacking around here
