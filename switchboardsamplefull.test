0 A:  Well, do, do they do other things for you all?  
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  We won't go through that again, I will pay someone [barking] to do it

0 B:  So, Utah.
1 B:  Yes, they do.
0 A:  That's right.
0 B:  Yeah, I think it'd be great.
1 A:  And, uh, you just don't know exactly what to expect when it goes like that,
0 B:  I think it's --
0 B:  I guess it's part of the warming trends.
1 B:  I'll let you go first [laughter].
1 A:  Oh, well, we're, you know, we're not going to eat the #whole thing
0 B:  Huh.
0 A:  -- and, um, they say that the average English student nowadays does at

1 A:  And things don't fit just quite exactly --
0 package.
1 B:  Yeah, it's really close to there.  We see the fireworks from our upstairs
0 B:  -- and he wanted to stay on the east coast because of the surroundings and
0 discussing going there, so, I, that sounds good.  How about fast food?  Do you
0 B:  Well, it was nice talking to you.
0 B:  Uh-huh.  I think that's been a positive development.  I think what that's
0 B:  Yeah, she's an editor, so she gets to do that.  And my sister.
0 they were the, they called them the bread winners, and they'd support the
0 B:  All right, #and what,#
0 B:  -- uh, how is the care, are you satisfied.  Um, it took me quite a while to
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].  And, and, uh, my choice of graduate schools was, uh, you
1 B:  Right.
0 yesterday, and that's why it always bothers me a little bit to give your
1 A:  Okay, well, you want to tell me about the weather [laughter]?
0 the fleas and bugs and whatever.
0 A:  We have to have a freeze for probably a week.  But aside from that, I hope
1 [laughter].
0 B:  My children don't go to it, but they were talking about starting it next
0 A:  -- and now, you know, since we've been mowing it, and, you know, of course
0 A:  Yeah --
1 result.
0 A:  [Laughter] Yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it.  That, and they're
0 A:  And opening up those stations, whatever, filling them.
1 A:  Some crazy hit man over there so, 
0 like, um, the computer panel or, or the whatever it was needed to be replaced

0 A:  -- got steaks and got out of town for a while.
1 A:  [Laughter].
0 B:  That's true.
0 A:  Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.
0 B:  Oh, uh-huh.
1 at that too, and it's just the, thoughts of it kind of scare me.
1 A:  So, I always try.
1 B:  A tent?
1 take for granted.
0 B:  I've never talked to anyone who's not from Dallas yet.  Have,
1 my wife [laughter].
0 we just all go to movies [laughter].
0 A:  And we're starting to do that.
0 B:  Um, [throat_clearing] yeah [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah [laughter].
0 B:  Yeah, I'm kind of surprised that they, uh, that they, that they hung onto
0 A:  They're doing well.
0 B:  I, I was raised with the old Dallas Chaparrals.

1 A:  Arlington, Texas now since I got somebody from Arlington, Virginia one day
0 Alabama.
0 B:  -- I enjoy it.
0 A:  Huh, yeah, that's a big one.
0 to have so many broken families and things like that, because I think that's
1 it's a hole in the water that you throw money into.
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  You might not do the flower beds.  I've had a guy that's in bugs --
0 B:  Oh, okay.
0 B:  -- and, uh,
1 B:  -- just for yourself, 
0 B:  Uh-huh.
0 violating civil rights when they're using these illegal drugs.
0 B:  And I, I'm sure that trend will continue.
0 B:  Yeah, yeah.
0 A:  Oh, I, I guess about, about the same as mine.  I don't see a whole lot of
0 B:  So, it's a small problem so far, but I guess you just have to keep on top
0 B:  It may be interesting to see how, when they start talking about border

0 B:  Yeah, well she just did them, I just got them a couple days ago, so.
0 jaunts to Chicago and different places around and that's fun, too.  That's a
1 A:  Oh, well, that's nice.
0 out, um, my twelve year old got out the Legos --
1 A:  You're kind of like, what are you talking about and, uh,
0 right amount, and then again, back to the food, I think that they have, uh, if
1 A:  -- to the drug scene, and, um, of course the little community we live in,
0 A:  Yeah, I don't know, it, you know, the, uh, funding situation seems to be
1 A:  No, I maybe have been home, oh, twice in the last two years for Christmas
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 that my sister and brother-in-law, as well as my parents, they, they use them
0 yourself --
0 and --
0 got a ways to go yet.  So far most of what I've done is getting, gotten core

0 baby --
0 A:  So.
1 A:  Yeah #[laughter].#
0 A:  Well, you must be, you must have a job then.
1 B:  -- I guess with the holidays and all, I haven't even picked up a book or a
1 B:  [Breathing] I don't even have time to go to lunch #[laughter].#
0 B:  -- #some# problem like that.  I really haven't had to return things because
0 A:  Most the time they have a pretty good guarantee, yeah.  The only thing I've
1 A:  -- cool mom then [laughter].  
0 A:  My mom would, would have never gone for that.  
1 B:  Well, I sing in a choir at church and I like, you know, that kind of thing
1 A:  Okay.  
1 B:  And, uh, my daughter plays basketball.  You wouldn't know it, would you, 
1 B:  -- but from the other team and he said, Christmas came early this year
1 A:  -- threw snowballs all over the place,
0 A:  Ouch.  
0 is Yeltsin all that great.
1 to, uh, and not have a completely socialized,
1 B:  I was going to say, that's a Black Forest cuckoo clock you have.
0 A:  And there it was death by hanging.  
1 take a week off in August and then when the,
0 A:  -- the, the latest in gardening trends unless you read a gardening
0 A:  And make, uh, make my job flexible in that case.  
0 section of woods bothers me a little bit --
0 A:  No, that's the -- 
1 Novacek and see Irwin out there and, and the no-name defense, so,
0 B:  And, you know, like I said, uh, the mileage on a mini van is about, oh,
1 Oscar said hippies are okay, my buddy [laughter].
1 B:  [Laughter]. 
0 B:  Ok-,
1 B:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  
0 A:  Right [laughter].  
0 benefits, uh, that has really forced people into doing a lot of things
0 A:  Uh-huh.  
1 A:  Uh-huh.  
0 bore pretty good size fruit.  And then one year we just let one of the
1 A:  Yeah.  
0 A:  Yeah, right now I am.  That's what brought me here, yeah.  
1 sometimes you're so busy you don't want to take an hour or so to sit down
1 probably as big as yours.
1 ever watch anything else.
1 A:  Oh, yes, if you're up then [laughter].  
1 B:  So,
0 B:  And then, uh, another state, I can't remember, but she told me about the
0 B:  All right.  
1 B:  -- and gravy and totally enjoy it.  
1 B:  And then can table that for six months to eight months to another year.
1 [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.  Oh, we had, uh, we have had six children, and so our house was
1 the floor plan now, uh, you probably wouldn't recognize where we started from.
0 together the aluminum and the bottles.  We put those all in one big bag, and
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 A:  So in fact --
1 B:  -- out of what, out of my savings account.  Not as well as the Japanese do.
1 B:  Yeah, I'm not very motivated [laughter].
1 you did that, that seemed to work best for you that you'd pass on to somebody
0 A:  [Laughter]  What are your hobbies?
1 [laughter].
1 A:  Or even if they don't, they can still take the test [laughter].
0 A:  Uh-huh.
0 to be honored.  However, uh, I think we could have executed the war and gotten
1 anti-war activist.
1 B:  #Yeah [laughter]. So do I#
1 A:  Uh, yeah, I've driven one im-, uh, I drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while,
1 A:  It was a lot of fun.  
0 B:  Yeah, anytime you try to walk down, the, the ushers are always ((taking you
1 B:  Yeah, or, uh, oh, I left them up in my seat.  
1 A:  And it's like yeah, it's easy to use, but you have to pay for it, you know
0 A:  Yeah.
1 what people are doing, and, uh, you know, and how, and how, how partisan and
0 B:  Yeah, I'm, I'm glad too [laughter].
1 A:  Yeah, I, I can go for that.
1 A:  Yes, uh-huh.  
0 B:  So it was quite a bit of work.
0 B:  And then finally found some, one, somewhere that was familiar with it,
0 B:  [Laughter] Well, that's what I always thought.  Actually, uh, the gals in

0 they get used to something, they're really nervous and.
1 B:  Oh, yeah.  I, I, uh, could probably go faster, but then I would wear myself
0 B:  Uh-huh.
1 said things like spaghetti [laughter] {Loud}.
0 pay too much attention.  I turn the radio on and I don't always pay attention
1 B:  #[Laughter].#
1 B:  That's right #[laughter].#
0 A:  Yeah.  That is true.  But I mean, on more of a national level, I guess.

0 was buying that I was concerned primarily with re-, reliability, and, but I
0 we're struggling with it.  Oh, [inhaling] the thing is that both our cars are
0 seems to be so low that, you know, I don't really see any benefit over, uh,
1 A:  Oh, really?  
1 congested and a lot of traffic so it's, you know, we use the clutch a lot

1 A:  Well, I haven't really thought about it like that [laughter].
0 B:  [Laughter].
0 B:  I recycle glass, plastic, and aluminum.  Also paper and plastic bags --

1 business degree in college and that's the most useless degree [laughter] --
0 provider --
0 just, it really depends [children_talking] on reliability for me --
